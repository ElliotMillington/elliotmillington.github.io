	abstract = {Video games are commonly of interest in autism, with autistic adolescents playing twice as much as their Typically Developing peers. The aims of this study are to investigate whether motivations to play video games measured using the Gaming Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences Scales and autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient can predict time spent playing video games. 57 participants were recruited from internet forums and completed an online questionnaire. The preliminary results revealed that only escapism and social motivation predicted time spent playing games. Further investigation revealed interactions between autistic traits and several motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and customisation. This has consequences for future research into how autistic people use video games to ease their anxieties.},

Despite this, current measures assessing sensory sensitivities do not appear to fully capture this, especially in children. This study aimed to adapt an adult measure of sensory sensitivities – the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire – for use with children aged between aged between 8 and 11. 234 children filled out this adaption while their caregivers completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient: Children’s Version. The results found that the two questionnaires had a significant but surprisingly small correlation. Future work should look at identifying the extent to which the Children’s Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is capturing greater sensory difficulties in non-autistic children or increased measurement error.},

	abstract = {Purpose Recent work could further improve the use of VR technology by advocating the use of psychological theories in task design and highlighting certain properties of VR configurations and human – VR interactions. The variety of VR technology used in the trials prevents us from establishing a systematic relationship between the technology type and its effectiveness. As such, more research is needed to study this link, and our piece is an attempt to shed a spotlight on the issue. Design/methodology/approach To explore recent developments in the field, the authors followed the procedures of scoping review by Savickaite et al. (2022) and included publications from 2021 to 2022. Findings In this updated analysis, it was clear that the research themes emerging over the last two years were similar to those identified previously. Social training and intervention work still dominates the research area, in spite of recent calls from the autism community to broaden the scientific understanding of neurodivergent experiences and daily living behaviours. Although, autism is often characterised by difficulties with social interactions, it is just one part of the presentation. Sensory differences, motor difficulties and repetitive behaviours are also important facets of the condition, as well as various wider aspects of health, wellbeing and quality of life. However, many of these topics appear to be understudied in research on VR applications for autism. Originality/value VR stands out from other representational technologies because of its immersion, presence and interactivity and has grown into its own niche. The question of what constitutes a truly immersive experience has resurfaced. We can no longer deny that VR has established itself in autism research. As the number of studies continues to grow, it is a perfect time to reconsider and update our notion of definitions of immersion and its reliance on hardware.},

	abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to raise awareness of and argue for the use of participatory methods for the research and development of Virtual Reality (VR) applications designed for neurodivergent groups. This includes exploring why it is important to meaningfully include neurodivergent groups and the benefits their inclusion provide. Design/methodology/approach VR is becoming increasingly widespread as a consumer product and interventional tool. It is vital for researchers and developers to embrace best practices in these early stages of using the technology, making certain that neurodivergent people have the best possible outcomes. Findings The neurodivergent community is dissatisfied with many of the research directions currently being undertaken. This dissatisfaction arises from conflicting priorities between different stakeholders and the lack of input from the community. Participatory research brings neurodivergent people into the research process, whether as members of the research team or as consultants at key steps. Effective participatory research ensures that the priorities of the neurodivergent community are better incorporated in research, as well as enabling the development of more effective applications for VR. Originality/value Participatory methods are unutilised in the development of applications aimed for neurodivergent people. By describing their use and utility in other areas, this article aims to encourage other VR researchers to take neurodivergent people on board.},

This is a proof of concept project to generate ideas that address this gap in knowledge, do fast, low-cost prototyping and user testing to further our understanding of the field. We built and tested the recognition of basic emotions in Meta Humans and cartoon avatars in VR. The aim was to understand whether the realism of the avatar impacts our perception of basic human emotion and the sense of immersion in VR.
