	abstract = {We propose that the domain general process of categorization contributes to the perception of stress. When a situation contains features associated with stressful experiences, it is categorized as stressful. From the perspective of situated cognition, the features used to categorize experiences as stressful are the features typically true of stressful situations. To test this hypothesis, we asked participants to evaluate the perceived stress of 572 imagined situations, and to also evaluate each situation for how much it possessed 19 features potentially associated with stressful situations and their processing (e.g., self-threat, familiarity, visual imagery, outcome certainty). Following variable reduction through factor analysis, a core set of 8 features associated with stressful situations-expectation violation, self-threat, coping efficacy, bodily experience, arousal, negative valence, positive valence, and perseveration-all loaded on a single Core Stress Features factor. In a multilevel model, this factor and an Imagery factor explained 88\% of the variance in judgments of perceived stress, with significant random effects reflecting differences in how individual participants categorized stress. These results support the hypothesis that people categorize situations as stressful to the extent that typical features of stressful situations are present. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to establish a comprehensive set of features that predicts perceived stress.},

	abstract = {This paper presents evidence from three samples, two of college students and one of partici- pants in a community smoking-cessation program, for the reliability and validity of a 14-item instrument, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), designed to measure the degree to which situations in one's life are appraised as stressful. The PSS showed adequate reliability and, as predicted, was correlated with life-event scores, depressive and physical symptomatology, utilization of health services, social anxiety, and smoking-reduction maintenance. In all com- parisons, the PSS was a better predictor of the outcome in question than were life-event scores. When compared to a depressive symptomatology scale, the PSS was found to measure a different and independently predictive construct. Additional data indicate adequate reliability and validity of a four-item version of the PSS for telephone interviews. The PSS is suggested for examining the role of nonspecific appraised stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders and as an outcome measure of experienced levels of stress.},

The present report is a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the efficacy of CBT for anxiety among youth with ASD. A systematic search identified 14 studies involving 511 youth with high-functioning ASD. A random effects meta-analysis yielded a statistically significant pooled treatment effect size (g) estimate for CBT (g = -0.71, p {\textless} .001) with significant heterogeneity [Q (13) = 102.27, p {\textless} .001]. Removal of a study outlier yielded a statistically significant pooled treatment effect size, (g = -0.47, p {\textless} .001). Anxiety informant and treatment modality were not statistically significant moderators of treatment response. Findings suggest that CBT demonstrates robust efficacy in reducing anxiety symptoms in youth with high-functioning ASD.

	abstract = {Background: Depression and anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and disabling disorders, which result not only in an enormous amount of human misery and lost health, but also lost economic output. Here we propose a global investment case for a scaled-up response to the public health and economic burden of depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: In this global return on investment analysis, we used the mental health module of the OneHealth tool to calculate treatment costs and health outcomes in 36 countries between 2016 and 2030. We assumed a linear increase in treatment coverage. We factored in a modest improvement of 5\% in both the ability to work and productivity at work as a result of treatment, subsequently mapped to the prevailing rates of labour participation and gross domestic product (GDP) per worker in each country. Findings: The net present value of investment needed over the period 2016-30 to substantially scale up effective treatment coverage for depression and anxiety disorders is estimated to be US\$147 billion. The expected returns to this investment are also substantial. In terms of health impact, scaled-up treatment leads to 43 million extra years of healthy life over the scale-up period. Placing an economic value on these healthy life-years produces a net present value of \$310 billion. As well as these intrinsic benefits associated with improved health, scaled-up treatment of common mental disorders also leads to large economic productivity gains (a net present value of \$230 billion for scaled-up depression treatment and \$169 billion for anxiety disorders). Across country income groups, resulting benefit to cost ratios amount to 2·3-3·0 to 1 when economic benefits only are considered, and 3·3-5·7 to 1 when the value of health returns is also included. Interpretation: Return on investment analysis of the kind reported here can contribute strongly to a balanced investment case for enhanced action to address the large and growing burden of common mental disorders worldwide.

Caregivers completed the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) and the Sensory Profile. Controlling for IQ and age, total RBS-R and Sensory Profile scores revealed significant correlations both prior to and after removing overlapping items. Examination of the co-occurrence of RBs and atypical sensory responses in this population suggests a subgroup has consistently high rates of problems in both RBs and sensory processing. In addition, this subgroup has high rates of prescribed psychoactive medications and co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses. The IQ and age of this subgroup did not differ significantly from the rest of the participants. Results are consistent with previous research describing the co-occurrence of RBs and sensory response abnormalities in the ASD population. Further investigation of the subset of individuals with ASD who have high rates of RBs and abnormal sensory responses may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of their clinical picture and improve interventions. Additionally, research with this subgroup may have significance for identifying a specific phenotype in ASD. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: For many children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), social interactions can be stressful. Previous research shows that youth with ASD exhibit greater physiological stress response during peer interaction, compared to typically developing (TD) peers. Heightened sensory sensitivity may contribute to maladaptive patterns of stress and anxiety. The current study investigated between-group differences in stress response to peer interaction, as well as the role of sensory sensitivity. Methods: Participants included 80 children (40 ASD) between 8 and 12 years. Children participated in the peer interaction paradigm (PIP), an ecologically valid protocol that simulates real-world social interaction. Salivary cortisol was collected before and after the 20 min PIP. Parents completed questionnaires pertaining to child stress (Stress Survey Schedule) and sensory sensitivity (Short Sensory Profile). Statistical analyses included t-tests and ANCOVA models to examine between-group differences in cortisol and play; Pearson correlations to determine relations between cortisol, play, and questionnaire scores; and moderation analyses to investigate interactions among variables. Results: Controlling for baseline cortisol values, children with ASD showed significantly higher cortisol levels than TD peers, in response to the PIP [F(1, 77) = 5.77, p = 0.02]. Cortisol during play was negatively correlated with scores on the SSP (r = -0.242, p = 0.03), and positively correlated with SSS (r = 0.273, p = 0.02) indicating that higher cortisol was associated with greater sensory sensitivity (lower SSP reflects more impairment) and enhanced stress in various contexts (higher SSS reflects more stress). Furthermore, diagnosis was a significant moderator of the relation between cortisol and SSP, at multiple time points during the PIP (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: The current study extends previous findings by showing that higher physiological arousal during play is associated with heightened sensory sensitivity and a pattern of increased stress in various contexts. Results are discussed in a broader context, emphasizing the need to examine relationships between social, behavioral, and physiological profiles in ASD to enhance understanding and improve treatments aimed at ameliorating stress and sensory dysfunction, while enhancing social skills.},

The child-report form (i.e., IUS for Children, or IUSC), and to a lesser extent the parent-report form, demonstrated strong internal consistency and convergent validity, evidenced by significant associations with anxiety and worry (and reassurance-seeking in the case of the child-report form). Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders scored higher than nonreferred community youth on both forms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated acceptable overall utility in distinguishing the 2 groups of youth. Findings provide preliminary support for use of the IUSC for continuous measurement of children's ability to tolerate uncertainty.},

The results show that all main components of the model were highly related to the discriminant function and that intolerance of uncertainty was pivotal in distinguishing GAD patients from non clinical subjects. Further, the discriminant function derived from these four process variables was very effective for classifying GAD patients and non clinical subjects into their respective groups. Overall, 82\% of subjects were correctly classified as 18 of 24 subjects in the GAD group and 18 of 20 subjects in the non clinical group were properly identified.

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify sensory subtypes in older children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and examine the relationship of sensory subtypes with anxiety levels in this group. Mothers of 57 children and adolescents with ASD aged 11–17 years (Mean age = 14 years. 2.4 months, SD = 1.81) completed the short sensory profile and Spence anxiety scales. Model-based cluster analysis was applied to sensory profile scores to identify sensory subtypes. Three sensory subtypes, sensory adaptive (N = 19), sensory moderate (N = 29) and sensory severe (N = 9) were identified. The results indicated that the differences between the subtypes were well characterised by the severity of sensory symptoms and were not attributable to sensory modality or varying types of sensory-related behaviors. Children and adolescents from the adaptive subtype had significantly lower anxiety scores when compared with other two subtypes.

	abstract = {Severe symptoms of anxiety add substantial additional burden to many individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Improved understanding of specific factors that contribute to anxiety in ASD can aid research regarding the causes of autism and also provide targets for more effective intervention. This mini-review focuses on emerging evidence for three concepts that appear to be related to each other and which also strongly predict anxiety in ASD samples. Atypical sensory function is included in the diagnostic criteria for ASD and is likely an important contributor to anxiety. Difficulties understanding and labeling emotions (alexithymia), although a co-morbidity, may arise in part from atypical sensory function and can lead to confusion and uncertainty about how to respond to social and emotional situations. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) describes people who have a particularly hard time with ambiguity and is known to be a key mechanism underlying some anxiety disorders. While evidence for linking these ideas is to date incomplete, we put forward a model including each concept as a framework for future studies. Specifically, we propose that IU is a critical mediator for anxiety in ASD, and explore the relationships between sensory function, alexithymia, and IU. We further explore the role of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in regulating emotional response, in connection with limbic and insula-based networks, and suggest that disrupted integration in these networks underlies difficulties with habituation to strong emotional stimuli, which results in an enhanced perception of threat in many people with ASD. Behavioral and biologically-based treatments for anxiety in ASD will benefit from attending to these specific mechanisms as adjunct to traditional interventions.},

Recent research indicates that intolerance of uncertainty (IU) may be an important aspect of anxiety for this population. IU is the belief that uncertainty is upsetting, and not knowing what is going to happen is negative. There is little known about the phenomenology of IU in children with ASD. We therefore present data from parent focus groups exploring this concept in children with ASD. METHODS: Participants were asked to differentiate IU from dislike of change and fear, and to discuss examples of IU and the strategies they use to manage it. Their experiences of IU and strategies are presented. RESULTS: IU was evident across novel and familiar situations and parents used a variety of strategies to manage IU. Their experiences of IU and strategies used are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were able to identify and provide examples of IU suggesting that it is a recognizable construct among children with ASD.},

Intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety explained approximately half the variance in autistic children’s sensory sensitivities, but only around a fifth of the variance in typical children’s sensory sensitivities.

	abstract = {Many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high levels of anxiety. A widely used measure for typically developing children is the Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS). However, such anxiety measures may require adaptation to accommodate characteristics of those with ASD. An adapted version of the RCADS was created based on empirical evidence of anxiety phenomenology in ASD, which included additional items related to sensory anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and phobias. Content validity was refined during focus groups with parents. Polychoric factor analysis was undertaken on data from 170 children with ASD, aged 8-16, and their parents. This process resulted in the creation of a new 24 item scale (self and parent report) each with four subscales: Performance Anxiety, Uncertainty, Anxious Arousal, and Separation Anxiety, with evidence of good reliability and validity. The freely available Anxiety Scale for Children - ASD, Parent and Child versions (ASC-ASD) has promising psychometric properties including good internal consistency, validity, and 1 month test–retest reliability.

	abstract = {More Americans now play video games than go to the movies (NPD Group, 2009). The meteoric rise in popularity of video games highlights the need for research approaches that can deepen our scientific understanding of video game engagement. This article advances a theory-based motivational model for examining and evaluating the ways by which video game engagement shapes psychological processes and influences well-being. Rooted in self-determination theory (Deci \& Ryan, 2000; Ryan \& Deci, 2000a), our approach suggests that both the appeal and well-being effects of video games are based in their potential to satisfy basic psychological needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness. We review recent empirical evidence applying this perspective to a number of topics including need satisfaction in games and short-term well-being, the motivational appeal of violent game content, motivational sources of postplay aggression, the antecedents and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement, and the determinants and effects of immersion. Implications of this model for the future study of game motivation and the use of video games in interventions are discussed. Psychological research examining video games is presently undergoing a dramatic shift in focus. Until very recently, the preponderance of research in video games has been concern-focused, with studies aimed at identifying the potential negative effects of gaming. Specific foci of these research programs have included the relations between gaming and increased aggression, social isolation , and overuse (Anderson \& Bushman, 2001; Grüsser, Thale-mann, \& Griffiths, 2007). Yet, more recently, a number of researchers have become intervention-focused, hoping to harness the magnetic motivational appeal of video games to help relieve pain and stress or customizing games for educational or health-related interventions (for a review, see Baranowski, Buday, Thompson, \& Baranowski, 2008). Increasingly, intervention-focused researchers are demonstrating that games can positively influence both psychological and physical well-being. Although the goals of both concern-focused and intervention-focused research are dissimilar, both share a descriptive research approach: The methods and theories they employ evaluate the extent to which video games exert positive, negative, or no influence on specified outcomes under a given set of circumstances. What is less well understood and less widely studied are the mechanisms that underlie these positive and negative links. In this article, we outline a theory-based empirical model for understanding and evaluating the processes through which video games motivate sustained engagement, and how experiences with these games affect the psychological and physical well-being of players. Our approach is based on self-determination theory (SDT; Deci \& Ryan, 2000; Ryan \& Deci, 2000a), a macrotheory of human motivation that is principally concerned with the potential of social contexts to provide experiences that satisfy universal human needs. We apply that theory to an understanding of how video gaming contexts satisfy or thwart psychological needs and thus foster or undermine sustained engagement and either positive or negative well-being outcomes for players. We present both direct and indirect empirical evidence that highlights the utility of our motivational approach, and show that it can inform such controversial topics as the appeal of violent games, the linkages between aggression and violent games, and the causes and consequences of disordered patterns of game engagement. The empirically based model we present here generates a number of novel and testable hypotheses, and thus has the potential of informing game-based interventions and supplying a better understanding of the positive and negative influences that video games exert on psychological and physical well-being.},

	abstract = {Screen media has become an intrinsic feature in the daily lives of children and youths with and without autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This systematic review provides a current overview concerning the significance of screen media in the lives of children and youths with ASD. For the years 2005 to 2016, we identified 47 studies covering media use among children and youths with ASD. These studies concordantly showed screen media as being a preferred leisure activity for children and youths with ASD, and reported mixed evidence compared to children without ASD. Further research on content, functionality, problematic media use, other leisure time activities, and quality of life is recommended. Keywords Media use. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Leisure time. Children. Adolescents With a lifetime prevalence of 2.24\% (Zablotsky et al. 2015), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a frequently occurring diagnosis in childhood. Its prevalence has increased in recent years (see also Zablotsky et al. 2015), probably because of the continued advancement in diagnostics. In the fourth edition (and revision) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the symptoms of ASD were categorized into autism, pervasive developmental disorders not otherwise specified, and Asperger syndrome (American Psychiatric Association 1998; American Psychiatric Association 2000). However, in the fifth edition of the DSM, these categorizations were dissolved and integrated into one diagnostic disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013). Two main criteria identified in the latest edition are (A) persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction and (B) restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (American Psychiatric Association 2013). These criteria refer, for instance, to problems regarding nonverbal communication, understanding relationships, sensory processing or changing situations, and they reflect the many challenges children or adolescents with ASD face in their daily lives (e.g., filtering relevant stimuli, handling social interactions, communicating, recognizing emotions). Hence, many studies focus on developing or optimizing supportive strategies, some of which use media and videos as a model learning component. In a review, Wainer and Ingersoll (2011) described different computer programs that focus on social communication skills (e.g., language, emotion recognition), and they expressed support for the positive effects of using computer technology in this context. As leisure time activities, screen-based and digital media have become a progressively integral part of the daily lives of children and youths. In a representative sample, Rideout et al. (2010) observed that 8-to 10-year-old children spent nearly 8 h a day with different types of media (e.g., TV, audio, computer), and 11-to 18-year-olds spent more than 11 h per day. International studies have reported that an excessive use of screen media can be linked to various negative outcomes when controlling for confounding variables, e.g., cognitive abilities, diet, or parenting. These negative outcomes include, for instance, poor school performance (Mößle et al.},

Significant associations were found between both autism, and anxiety, and internet addiction. However, the association between autism traits and internet addiction was moderated by high level for anxiety, such that individuals with high numbers of autism traits showed less evidence of internet addiction if they also displayed high levels of anxiety.

	abstract = {The playground is a space where play is encouraged and happens most freely. Online communities can be imagined as playgrounds. In addition to face-to-face playgrounds, these “online playgrounds” mediate the embodied experience, but in a different way. In the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), to better understand play, I shift the focus from using technology to assist children with disabilities engage in normative play, to using technology that supports children’s play—whether normative or not. Work in other fields upholds normative, face-to-face interactions as the goal in any social interaction. Current research often holds offline and online as two distinct experiences with many caregivers, teachers, parents, and researchers privileging the experiences that happen in the physical, face-to-face realm—the physical-world playground. In HCI, studying technology for play is often acknowledged only to accomplish specific goals (such as education, skill mastery, or improving health). When stakeholders use technology for play simply for the sake of play, normative interactions are the focal point, such as with able-bodied children. In technology research, children with disabilities are not ignored altogether, but rather when technology for play is studied for disabled children the technology becomes an aid—a support to allow the children more normative interactions. Being disabled inherently means not fitting into and not adhering to the normative embodied interactions. When we assume a normative way of engaging as the best or only way to interact, there will be people who are excluded. In a digital ethnography conducted in Autcraft, an online community centered around a Minecraft world for children with autism, we can see how online communities can become “online playgrounds” and used as an alternative place to play. This dissertation aims to re-center technology design to support topos-mediated ludic sociality—the various ways sociality as an embodied experience is mediated by playful place—rather than focusing on how technology can be used to normalize social interactions.},

	abstract = {Social online games are a mass phenomenon and, for most of the users, a social activity. Even though there are numerous studies on social online games they do not explicitly investigate the offline contacts of the gamers, which play a significant role for their social embeddedness. Regarding the online gaming-related contacts possible strong ties such as friendship relationships are often neglected. Additionally modality switching between the two spheres is not further investigated. In this paper, we strive to extend the research on the interrelation of social game use and the social embeddedness of social online gamers, as well as modality switching between the online and offline context. In doing so we provide new insights into the emergence and quality of gaming-related relationships. We collected information on everyday life as well as on gaming-related friendships from a representative sample of 2213 gamers and 287 non-gamers in Germany. Our results show that social online gamers do not differ significantly from other gamers or non-gamers regarding the number of their good friends. However, we found a significant impact of social online gaming frequency on the probability of meeting exclusively online friends. Different social motives played an important role for modality switching processes. Players with a pronounced motive to gain social capital and to play in a team had the highest probability to transform their social relations from online to offline context. We found that social online gamers are well integrated and use the game to spend time with old friends - and to recruit new ones. Our results suggest that gaming-related ties might be very useful: especially modality switching between the two spheres might lead to strong ties and accordingly to additional bonding social capital. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Results Results indicated the participants perceived playing videogames to have a positive impact on their lives and their development. The motivations for playing videogames described are similar to those reported by typically developing populations. Conclusions Videogaming is a popular leisure pursuit for adolescents and young adults with and without ASD. Speech-language pathologists should consider how videogame play may be a useful context for teaching new communication, social, and language.},

Methods We performed latent class analysis in a sample of 9733 adolescents based on heavy use of games, social networking and instant messaging, and game addiction symptoms. We used latent class regression to determine associations between classes, psychosocial well-being and friendship quality. Results We identified two types of heavy gaming classes that differed in probability of online social interaction. Classes with more online social interaction reported fewer problematic gaming symptoms than those with less online social interaction. Most adolescents estimated to be in heavy gaming classes had more depressive symptoms than normative classes. Male non-social gamers had more social anxiety. Female social gamers had less social anxiety and loneliness, but lower self-esteem. Friendship quality attenuated depression in some male social gamers, but strengthened associations with loneliness in some male non-social gamers. Conclusions In adolescents, symptoms of video game addiction depend not only on video game play but also on concurrent levels of online communication, and those who are very socially active online report fewer symptoms of game addiction.},

The present study verified differences in experiencing loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) and social anxiety (Social Phobia Inventory) in WoW players in online and real world (offline) since these two worlds and the functioning of the players in them differ. In the sample consisting of 161 players, it was found that players experience a significantly lower degree of loneliness and social anxiety in online than in real world. The lower degree of loneliness experienced was also associated with playing with friends and known people, with guild membership, as well as frequent communication with teammates through VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) services.

	abstract = {Low emotional support is associated with poor health outcomes. Engagement with face-to-face social networks is one way of increasing emotional support. However, it is not yet known whether engagement with proliferating electronic social networks is similarly associated with increased emotional support. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess associations between social media use and perceived emotional support in a large, nationally-representative sample. In October 2014, we collected data from 1796 U.S. adults ages 19-32. We assessed social media use using both total time spent and frequency of visits to each of the 11 most popular social media platforms. Our dependent variable was perceived emotional support as measured by the brief Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) emotional support scale. A multivariable model including all sociodemographic covariates and accounting for survey weights demonstrated that, compared with the lowest quartile of time on social media, being in the highest quartile (spending two or more hours per day) was significantly associated with decreased odds of having higher perceived emotional support (AOR 0.62, 95 \% CI 0.40, 0.94). However, compared with those in the lowest quartile, being in the highest quartile regarding frequency of social media use was not significantly associated with perceived emotional support (AOR 0.70, 95 \% CI 0.45, 1.09). In conclusion, while the cross-sectional nature of these data hinder inference regarding directionality, it seems that heavy users of social media may actually feel less and not more emotional support.},

Of the 84 percent of the sample who used SM, those who used Facebook, the most popular site, were happier than those who did not. The same relationship did not exist for the second most popular site, Twitter. Happiness and SM use showed a quadratic relationship: Happiness and SM use increased together until they reached a point where happiness fell off.

	doi = {10.1037/a0034857},
	abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97\% playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of "gaming" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so. © 2013 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Readability formulas are being increasingly used to measure the understandability of written information in clinical and health settings. This paper examines the most commonly used formulas (Dale-Chall Formula, Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Formula, Fog Index, Fry Readability Graph, and SMOG Grading). Their reliability and validity when used in health-related areas are discussed, and findings resulting from their use are described. These findings show that much of the material written for patients and clients, in the areas of informed consent, illnesses and their investigation and treatment, and lifestyle advice, is too difficult for many of them to understand. It is also concluded that increasing readability usually leads to improvement in understanding and occasionally in co-operation with treatment. Finally, methods for supplementing the information gained from readability formulas are described. © Journals Oxford Ltd.},

	abstract = {Children are no longer neglected as respondents in large-scale surveys. Researchers are convinced that information about perspectives, attitudes, and behaviors of children should be collected from the children themselves. Regarding adults, empirical evidence shows that respondent characteristics as well as question characteristics affect response quality. Because children are in process of developing their cognitive and social skills, it is expected that answering questions in surveys brings along additional problems concerning response quality. So far however, methodological expertise on surveying children is scarce, and researchers rely on ad-hoc knowledge from fields such as child psychiatry and educational testing, or on methodological knowledge on surveying adults. In this article we report results of a secondary analysis on several data sets. The multi level meta-analysis was directed on the (interaction) effects of child characteristics and question characteristics on the reliability of responses.},

METHODS: Literature searches used to identify studies which evaluated parent-child agreement for child HRQL measures. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were identified, including four HRQL instruments. The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) was most commonly used. Differences in parent-child agreement were noted between domains for different measures. The impact of child and parent characteristics were not consistently considered; however parents of children in a nonclinical sample tended to report higher child HRQL scores than children themselves, while parents of children with health conditions tended to underestimate child HRQL. CONCLUSION: Despite increasing numbers of studies considering children's HRQL, information about variables contributing to parent-child agreement levels remains limited. Authors need to consistently provide evidence for reliability and validity of measures, and design studies to systematically investigate variables that impact on levels of parent-child agreement.},

	abstract = {The ability to reflect on our own and others' thoughts and emotions (that is, theory of mind) is a defining characteristic of human cognition. Children with autism spectrum conditions (ASCs; henceforth 'autism') show delays in the development of this capacity 1 , with knock‑on consequences for cognitive empathy 2 across the lifespan. Interestingly, these alterations in social cognition are accompanied by a very different percep‑ tual experience of the world. Atypical sensory experi‑ ence is estimated to occur in as many as 90\% of autistic individuals 3,4 and to affect every sensory modality: taste 5 , touch 6,7 , audition 8 , smell 9,10 and vision 11 . A central challenge of autism research is to identify the common thread that unites these various aspects of cognition and sensation. What neurobiological alterations might affect processes as disparate as social cognition and sensory perception? This challenge is highlighted by the latest interna‑ tional diagnostic criteria for autism, which now include sensory sensitivities as a core diagnostic feature 12 . Although sensory symptoms were noted in early reports of the condition 13 , they have historically been construed as secondary aspects of autistic cognition rather than as primary phenotypic markers (see Supplementary infor‑ mation S1 (box)). As well as having clinical implications for creating autism‑friendly environments, understand‑ ing the importance of sensory differences in autism is crucial for neurobiological accounts of the condition. Because the neural computations underlying sensory processing are relatively well understood in typically developing individuals and are conserved between humans and other animals, studies of sensory behaviour have considerable potential for shedding light on autistic neurobiology 14},

As those with ASD exist at the extreme end of a continuum of autistic traits that is also evident in the general population, we investigated the link between ASD and sensory sensitivity in the general population by administering two questionnaires online to 212 adult participants. Results showed a highly significant positive correlation (r = .775, p {\textless} .001) between number of autistic traits and the frequency of sensory processing problems. These data suggest a strong link between sensory processing and autistic traits in the general population, which in turn potentially implicates sensory processing problems in social interaction difficulties.},

In Study 1, factor analysis of restricted and repetitive behaviors was carried out using the Repetitive Behavior Questionnaire-2 (RBQ-2), completed by 120 parents of 2- to 17-year-olds with ASD. Two subtypes resulted: repetitive sensory and motor behaviors, and insistence on sameness, accounting for 40\% of the variance. This two-factor solution was retained even when the sensory items of the RBQ-2 were removed. In Study 2, 49 of the same parents also completed the Spence Anxiety Scales and the Sensory Profile. The insistence on sameness factor was significantly associated with anxiety while the repetitive motor behaviors factor was not. The relation between anxiety and insistence on sameness was mediated by sensory avoiding and to a lesser extent by sensory sensitivity.

	abstract = {Although under some conditions the attention-related late positive event-related potential (ERP) response (LPC) is apparently normal in autism during visual processing, the LPC elicited by visuospatial processing may be compromised. Results from this study provide evidence for abnormalities in autism in two components of the LPC generated during spatial processing. The early frontal distribution of the LPC which may reflect attention orienting was delayed or missing in autistic subjects during conditions in which attention was to peripheral visual fields. The later parietal distribution of the LPC which may be associated with context updating was smaller in amplitude in autistic subjects regardless of attention location. Both abnormalities suggest disruption of function in spatial attention networks in autism. Evidence that the cerebellar abnormalities in autism may underlie these deficits comes from: (1) similar results in ERP responses and spatial attention deficits in patients with cerebellar lesions; (2) brain-behavior correlations in normally functioning individuals associating the size of the posterior cerebellar vermis and the latency of the frontal LPC; and (3) a previously reported complementary correlation between the size of the posterior vermal lobules and spatial orienting speed. Although the scalp-recorded LPC is thought to be cortically generated, it may be modulated by subcortical neural activity. The cerebellum may serve as a modulating influence by affecting the task-related antecedent attentional process. The electrophysiological abnormalities reported here index spatial attention deficits in autism that may reflect cerebellar influence on both frontal and parietal spatial attention function. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Research with adults has shown that variations in verbal labels and numerical scale values on rating scales can affect the responses given. However, few studies have been conducted with children. The study aimed to examine potential differences in children's responses to Likert-type rating scales according to their anchor points and scale direction and to see whether or not such differences were stable over time. A total of 130 British children, aged 9 to 11 years, completed six sets of Likert-type rating scales, presented in four different ways varying the position of positive labels and numerical values. The results showed, both initially and 8-12 weeks later, that presenting a positive label or a high score on the left of a scale led to significantly higher mean scores than did the other variations. These findings indicate that different arrangements of rating scales can produce different results, which has clear implications for the administration of scales with children. © 2012 British Educational Research Association.},

	abstract = {Sensory sensitivities have been linked to autism in a growing body of literature. Despite this, current measures assessing sensory sensitivities do not appear to fully capture this. This study aimed to adapt an adult measure of a sensory sensitivities – the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ: Robertson \& Simmons, 2013) – to address the sensory sensitivities of children aged 8-11 years. It was also intended to validate the adult GSQ in a sample of adolescents aged 12-15 years. Studies 1a and 1b assessed the most effective medium of pictorially representing the GSQ questions. Study 1a found no significant differences between three mediums (hand-drawn; photograph; cartoon), however a unanimous preference was found for the cartoon medium in study 1b. The Pictured-GSQ (P-GSQ) was created in line with this finding. Study 2a tested the ease of understanding of P-GSQ pictures and questions, in children aged 8-11 years, by means of a picture-matching paradigm. The results of this showed a poor understanding of some questions presented. Study 2b assessed the relationship between GSQ and Autism Quotient (AQ) scores in a sample of adolescents aged 12-15. It was found that there was no significant relationship between these two measures. This is in contrast to the adult literature and is discussed further in relation to previous studies. It is concluded that the P-GSQ for children and the GSQ for adolescents need to be adapted before providing effective measures of sensory sensitivities.},

Pretesting of questions is especially important when researching populations about which relatively little is known, or who are likely to be especially sensitive to failings of questionnaire design. Children fall into this category because relatively little is known about how the question–answer model applies to them, and because their cognitive, memory, communicative and social faculties are still developing.With this in mind, I describe two key methods of question-testing, namely review by expert panel and in-depth cognitive interviewing.},

	abstract = {Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0–50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 327plus; on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test—retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

METHODS Participants included parents of boys with ASD (n = 49), ADHD (n = 38), or TD (n = 41) (ages 8-17 years). Questionnaires assessed daily hours of media use, bedroom access to media, and average sleep hours per night. RESULTS Bedroom media access was associated with less time spent sleeping per night, irrespective of diagnostic group. Bedroom access to a television or a computer was more strongly associated with reduced sleep among boys with ASD compared with boys with ADHD or TD. Multivariate models showed that, in addition to bedroom access, the amount of time spent playing video games was uniquely associated with less sleep among boys with ASD. In the ASD group only, the relationship between bedroom access to video games and reduced sleep was mediated by hours of video game play. CONCLUSIONS The current results suggest that media-related variables may be an important consideration in understanding sleep disturbances in children with ASD. Further research is needed to better characterize the processes by which media use may affect sleep among individuals with ASD. Overall, the current findings suggest that screen-based media time and bedroom media access should be routinely assessed and may be important intervention targets when addressing sleep problems in children with ASD.},

	abstract = {Anxiety is one of the most common co-occurring psychiatric conditions in youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). This article reviews recent evidence as well as earlier relevant studies regarding the characteristics, assessment, and treatment of anxiety in youth with ASD. RECENT FINDINGS: It is well established that the prevalence of anxiety in youth with an ASD is significantly greater than the prevalence of anxiety in the general population. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of informant, method, and instrument when measuring anxiety in this population. Despite the high prevalence, findings to date have been unable to identify any consistent risk factors for anxiety. New psychological treatments, including modified cognitive behavioral therapy for youth with high functioning ASD and co-occurring anxiety, are emerging. Pharmacological data, however, are scant. Existing studies show that youth with ASD are at increased risk for behavioral activation when taking SSRIs. SUMMARY: Clinicians working with youth with ASD are encouraged to routinely screen for anxiety. Until further data are available, clinical judgment is needed when prescribing treatments, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which require close monitoring of side-effects. Research on risk factors, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition is needed.},

The current study addresses this question by evaluating the link between gaming-related friendships and shyness, as quantified by emotional sensitivity. Drawing from a representative sample of German game players, the results indicate that emotionally sensitive players are using online gaming spaces differently from their less emotionally sensitive counterparts and reporting tangible differences in their in-game friendship networks. This suggests that online games hold the potential to be socially advantageous for shy individuals by allowing them to overcome their traditional social difficulties and generate new friendships as well as strengthen old ones.},

These factors demonstrated excellent fit in a subsequent confirmatory factor analysis, and, importantly, were found to reliably discriminate between inter-individual game preferences (e.g., Super Mario Brothers as compared to Call of Duty). Moreover, three factors were significantly related to pathological game use: the use of games to escape daily life, the use of games as a social outlet, and positive attitudes toward the steady accumulation of in-game rewards.

The results indicated that adults with ASD endorsed more symptoms of video game pathology than did TD adults. This relationship was strong, enjoying 300,000-to-1 odds in Bayesian model comparison. Results also showed that adults with ASD spent more daily hours playing video games and spent a higher percent of their free time playing video games than did TD adults. Even after adjustment for these differences in daily video game hours and proportion of free time spent on games, model comparisons found evidence for a difference in game pathology scores associated with ASD status. Additionally, escapism motives for playing video games was associated with game pathology scores in both ASD and TD adults, replicating and extending a previous report. In conclusion, the risk for pathological game use appears larger in adults with ASD compared with TD adults.

Previous studies have found that screen-based social media use can enhance social functioning for adults in the general population, yet studies have not yet examined social media use among adults with ASD. The purpose of this study was to examine patterns and social-emotional correlates of social media use in a sample of 108 adults with ASD. Participants completed self-report measures of social media use, friendship quality and quantity, and loneliness. The results indicated that the majority of participants (79.6\%) used social networking sites (SNS), and that the most commonly cited reason for using SNS was social connection. Adults with ASD who used SNS were more likely to have close friends, and those who used SNS for social engagement reported closer friendship relationships. However, greater offline friendship quality and quantity, not social media use, were associated with decreased loneliness in the current sample. This was the first study to explore patterns of social media use among adults with ASD, andthe findings suggest a need for further longitudinal research to examine the relations among these variables over time.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This group has also shown a particular interest for screen-based media and computer-games. Online multiplayer games have shown to promote social interaction and friendship building among the general population, however, no study has yet investigated these possibilities for persons with ASD. The current study aims to investigate the possible links between online gaming, loneliness and friendships in a sample of 85 adolescents and adults with ASD and a control group of 71 participants. Data was gathered through self-reported questionnaires. Results indicated that within the ASD sample, persons who play online games have more friends than those who do not. Motives to play online games differed between the ASD sample and the control group. Additionally, low to moderate use of online games was linked with less loneliness experienced among participants with ASD. However, friendship quality and having a best or close friend were not linked with online gaming. The results provide the first findings for connections between online gaming, loneliness and friendships among individuals with ASD. It also provides evidence for future studies to further investigate the possible casual effects between online gaming, loneliness and friendship among individuals with ASD.},

Although problematic video game use has been associated with behavior problems among typically developing children, the relationship between these variables has not been previously examined among children with ASD. The current study examined the relationships between aspects of video game use and problem behaviors among a sample of 169 boys (ages 8-18) with ASD. Parents reported on their children's behavioral functioning and video game habits and preferences, including the average number of hours spent playing video games per day, preferred game types (genres), and problematic (i.e., addictive) video game play patterns. The results revealed that problematic video game use was significantly correlated with inattention and oppositional behavior. Boys who played Role-Playing games had higher levels of both problematic game use and oppositional behavior. Finally, problematic game use and Role-Playing game genre were significant predictors of oppositional behavior, even when controlling for age and amount of time spent playing video games. The results highlight the clinical importance of examining video game use patterns among children with ASD, and indicate a need for future experimental and longitudinal research in this area. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Leading evidence for this thesis derives from functional neuroimaging, a methodology ill-suited for detailed assessment of sensory transmission dynamics occurring at the millisecond scale. Electrophysiological assessments of this thesis, however, are sparse and unconvincing. We conducted detailed examination of visual and somatosensory evoked activity using high-density electrical mapping in individuals with autism (N = 20) and precisely matched neurotypical controls (N = 20), recording large numbers of trials that allowed for exhaustive timefrequency analyses at the single-trial level. Measures of intertrial coherence and event-related spectral perturbation revealed no convincing evidence for an unreliability account of sensory responsivity in autism. Indeed, results point to robust, highly reproducible response functions marked for their exceedingly close correspondence to those in neurotypical controls.},

We found typical prior-based performance improvements irrespective of ASD-like traits or ASD diagnosis, suggesting that the fast formation and application of specific priors is preserved in ASD. Together with earlier studies reporting intact use of other types of perceptual priors, these findings narrow down the candidate Bayesian accounts that are plausible for ASD.},

Here, behavioral and pupillometric measurements indicated that adults with ASD are less surprised than neurotypical adults when their expectations are violated, and decreased surprise is predictive of greater symptom severity. A hierarchical Bayesian model of learning suggested that in ASD, a tendency to overlearn about volatility in the face of environmental change drives a corresponding reduction in learning about probabilistically aberrant events, thus putatively rendering these events less surprising. Participant-specific modeled estimates of surprise about environmental conditions were linked to pupil size in the ASD group, thus suggesting heightened noradrenergic responsivity in line with compromised neural gain. This study offers insights into the behavioral, algorithmic and physiological mechanisms underlying responses to environmental volatility in ASD.},

There is evidence that low-level sensory-processing deficits precede and underlie phonological problems, which are one of the best-documented aspects of RD. RD is also associated with impairments in integrating visual symbols with their corresponding speech sounds. Although causal relationships between sensory processing, print–speech integration, and fluent reading, and their neural bases are debated, these processes all require precise timing mechanisms across distributed brain networks. Neural excitability and neural noise are fundamental to these timing mechanisms. Here, we propose that neural noise stemming from increased neural excitability in cortical networks implicated in reading is one key distal contributor to RD.},

Given fundamental and inescapable effects of noise on nearly all aspects of neural processing, this could be a critical abnormality with broad implications for perception, behavior, and cognition. However, this proposal has been challenged by both theoretical and empirical studies. A crucial question is whether and how internal noise limits perception in ASD, independently from other sources of perceptual inefficiency, such as the ability to filter out external noise. Here, we separately estimated internal noise and external noise filtering in ASD. In children and adolescents with and without ASD, we computationally modeled individuals' visual orientation discrimination in the presence of varying levels of external noise. The results revealed increased internal noise and worse external noise filtering in individuals with ASD. For both factors, we also observed high inter-individual variability in ASD, with only the internal noise estimates significantly correlating with severity of ASD symptoms. We provide evidence for reduced perceptual efficiency in ASD that is due to both increased internal noise and worse external noise filtering, while highlighting internal noise as a possible contributing factor to variability in ASD symptoms.},

The purpose of this study was to use qualitative methods to examine the preferences and motivations for video game play among adults with ASD. Individual interviews were conducted with 58 adults with ASD, and responses were coded through an iterative and collaborative process. Several themes were identified, including perceived benefits of video game use (e.g., social connection, stress reduction) as well as perceived negative effects (e.g., time use, addictive potential). Participants also noted both positive and negative aspects of game design that affect their overall enjoyment. The most frequent all-time favorite video game genres were Role-Playing (31\%) and Action-Adventure (19\%). These qualitative findings enhance our understanding of video game use from the direct perspectives of individuals with ASD, and suggest a need for incorporating these perspectives in future quantitative studies on positive and negative aspects of game use in this population.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to examine video game use in boys with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with those with ADHD or typical development (TD) and to examine how specific symptoms and game features relate to problematic video game use across groups. METHODS: Participants included parents of boys (aged 8-18) with ASD (n = 56), ADHD (n = 44), or TD (n = 41). Questionnaires assessed daily hours of video game use, in-room video game access, video game genres, problematic video game use, ASD symptoms, and ADHD symptoms. RESULTS: Boys with ASD spent more time than did boys with TD playing video games (2.1 vs 1.2 h/d). Both the ASD and ADHD groups had greater in-room video game access and greater problematic video game use than the TD group. Multivariate models showed that inattentive symptoms predicted problematic game use for both the ASD and ADHD groups; and preferences for role-playing games predicted problematic game use in the ASD group only. CONCLUSIONS: Boys with ASD spend much more time playing video games than do boys with TD, and boys with ASD and ADHD are at greater risk for problematic video game use than are boys with TD. Inattentive symptoms, in particular, were strongly associated with problematic video game use for both groups, and role-playing game preferences may be an additional risk factor for problematic video game use among children with ASD. These findings suggest a need for longitudinal research to better understand predictors and outcomes of video game use in children with ASD and ADHD.},

The majority of youths with ASD (64.2\%) spent most of their free time using non-social media (television, video games), while only 13.2\% spent time on social media (email, internet chatting). Compared with other disability groups (speech/language impairments, learning disabilities, intellectual disabilities), rates of non-social media use were higher among the ASD group, and rates of social media use were lower. Demographic and symptom-specific correlates were also examined.},

An increasing number of studies have highlighted the potentially important role that intolerance of uncertainty may have in anxiety for those on the spectrum, as well as their interrelationships with sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviours. In response to a lack of studies involving adults, this study examined self-report survey data regarding intolerance of uncertainty, sensory sensitivities, repetitive behaviours and anxiety in a sample of 176 adults on the autism spectrum (mean age = 42). Intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety were both found to be elevated relative to non-autistic adults (N = 116) and significant, positive correlations were found between intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety, repetitive behaviours and sensory sensitivities in those on the spectrum. Intolerance of uncertainty was found to be a significant mediator between sensory sensitivities and anxiety, as well as between anxiety and insistence on sameness behaviours. These results were not sensitive to age. Intolerance of uncertainty is an important factor to be considered in the conceptualisation and management of elevated rates of anxiety for adults on the autism spectrum.},

Anxiety may worsen during adolescence, as young people face an increasingly complex social milieu and often become more aware of their differences and interpersonal difficulties. This review summarizes the state of research on the prevalence, phenomenology, and treatment of anxiety in youth with autism and related conditions such as Asperger's Disorder. Using search words autism, asperger(s), or pervasive developmental disorder and anxiety or anxious to find reports published between 1990 and 2008, this review identified 40 papers. The results of the review suggest that anxiety, whether measured categorically or dimensionally, is indeed common in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders and may be a source of additional morbidity. The assessment of anxiety disorders in ASD should be conducted using multiple informants and modalities, as children with ASD often do not display age-typical symptoms of anxiety. To date, relatively few controlled intervention studies using well-characterized samples have been conducted despite preliminary evidence for efficacy of select pharmacological and psychosocial approaches. Recommendations for future applied research are presented and clinical implications are explored.},

Method: Caregivers of 258 children in five diagnostic groups (Autism, PDD, DD/MR, Other DD, Typical) ages 5-80 months completed the SEQ. Results: The SEQ's internal consistency was α′ = .80. Prevalence of overall sensory symptoms for the Autism group was 69\%. Sensory symptoms were inversely related to mental age. The Autism group had significantly higher symptoms than either the Typical or DD groups and presented with a unique pattern of response to sensory stimuli - hyporesponsiveness in both social and nonsocial contexts. A pattern of hyperresponsiveness was similar in the Autism and DD groups, but significantly greater in both clinical groups than in the Typical group. Conclusion: The SEQ was able to characterize sensory features in young children with autism, and differentiate their sensory patterns from comparison groups. These unique sensory patterns have etiological implications, as well as relevance for assessment and intervention practices. © 2005 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.},

ANS is also involved in modulating sensory processing and sensory dysfunction has been widely reported in children with ASD. However, the potential association between physiological measurements of PLR and behavioral observations (e.g. sensory behaviors) has not been examined extensively in literature. In this study, we investigated the potential correlation between PLR and frequently observed sensory behaviors in children with ASD. We found a significant association between PLR constriction amplitude and a set of sensory behaviors in the ASD group but not in typically developing children. Children with ASD who showed more atypical sensory behaviors also had smaller PLR constriction amplitudes. A smaller PLR constriction amplitude suggests lower parasympathetic modulation. This observation implies that some atypical sensory behaviors in children with ASD could be associated with decreased parasympathetic modulation.},

A descriptive analysis of the data set of children with autism identified the distribution of responses on each item. A multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) on each category of the Sensory Profile identified possible differences among subjects without autism, with mild or moderate autism, and with severe autism. Follow-up univariate analyses were conducted for any category that yielded a significant result on the MANCOVA. Results. Eighty-four of 99 items (85\%) on the Sensory Profile differentiated the sensory processing skills of subjects with autism from those of subjects without autism. There were no group differences between subjects with mild or moderate autism and subjects with severe autism. Conclusion. The Sensory Profile can provide information about the sensory processing skills of children with autism to assist occupational therapists in assessing and planning intervention for these children.},

Thirty children with ASD and 21 comparison children without ASD completed the Spence Children's Anxiety Scale and the Children's Depression Inventory, with parents completing the parent version of both questionnaires. Intraclass correlations revealed that there was good agreement between ASD children and their parents on both measures, but only on the depression measure in non-ASD children. The children in both groups also completed the Children's Automatic Thoughts Questionnaires; multiple regression analyses indicated that within the ASD group, child-rated scores on the CATS questionnaire were positively related to increased self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, but not in the comparison group, suggesting that children with ASD are able to accurately report their anxious and depressed cognitions.

The idea is put forward, based on the experience of a large number of experimental studies, that there are two orthogonal components that contribute to this realistic response. The first is 'being there', often called 'presence', the qualia of having a sensation of being in a real place. We call this place illusion (PI). Second, plausibility illusion (Psi) refers to the illusion that the scenario being depicted is actually occurring. In the case of both PI and Psi the participant knows for sure that they are not 'there' and that the events are not occurring. PI is constrained by the sensorimotor contingencies afforded by the virtual reality system. Psi is determined by the extent to which the system can produce events that directly relate to the participant, the overall credibility of the scenario being depicted in comparison with expectations. We argue that when both PI and Psi occur, participants will respond realistically to the virtual reality.},

Our first argument is that VR can be useful by virtue of its differences from the normal perceptual environment. That is, by virtue of its relative non-realism and poverty of its perceptual elements, it can actually offer increased clarity with respect to the features of interest for the researcher. Our second argument is that VR exerts its measurable influence more by eliciting an acceptance of the virtual world (i.e., 'suspension of disbelief') rather than by eliciting a true belief of the realism of the VR environment. We conclude by providing a novel suggestion for combining neuroimaging methods with embodied VR that relies on the suspension of disbelief.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that individuals who exhibit heightened sensitivity also exhibit higher rates and severity of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. This line of research has been conducted almost exclusively through caregiver reports of sensitivity. Here, a more rigorous psychophysics paradigm was applied to assess sensory sensitivity and relate hypersensitivity to restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. In addition, commonly used questionnaire measures of sensory sensitivity were collected to determine if self-reported measures accurately reflect behavioural measures of sensory sensitivity. In all, 90 typically developing participants completed a visual detection task, a questionnaire measure of sensory processing and a measure of restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Visual sensitivity, measured both behaviourally and with questionnaires, is positively related to restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Surprisingly, visual sensitivity as measured behaviourally and through self-report are unrelated. Furthermore, a regression analysis suggests that while restricted interests and repetitive behaviours can be predicted based on both behavioural and self-reported sensitivity, these two predictors account for different portions of the variance in restricted interests and repetitive behaviours. Thus, while these results provide evidence supporting the contribution of sensory sensitivity to restricted interests and repetitive behaviours, these results also indicate that behavioural and questionnaire measures of sensory sensitivity are measuring two distinct constructs. We hypothesize that behavioural measures are measuring sensory sensitivity, while questionnaires measures are in fact measuring sensory reactivity.},

	abstract = {Background: Questionnaire-based studies suggest atypical sensory perception in over 90\% of individuals with autism spectrum conditions (ASC). Sensory questionnaire-based studies in ASC mainly record parental reports of their child's sensory experience; less is known about sensory reactivity in adults with ASC. Given the DSM-5 criteria for ASC now include sensory reactivity, there is a need for an adult questionnaire investigating basic sensory functioning. We aimed to develop and validate the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ), which assesses basic sensory hyper- and hyposensitivity across all five modalities. Methods. A total of 359 adults with (n = 196) and without (n = 163) ASC were asked to fill in the SPQ, the Sensory Over-Responsivity Inventory (SensOR) and the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) online. Results: Adults with ASC reported more sensory hypersensitivity on the SPQ compared to controls (P {\textless} .001). SPQ scores were correlated with AQ scores both across groups (r =.-38) and within the ASC (r = -.18) and control groups (r = -.15). Principal component analyses conducted separately in both groups indicated that one factor comprising 35 items consistently assesses sensory hypersensitivity. The SPQ showed high internal consistency for both the total SPQ (Cronbach's alpha =.92) and the reduced 35-item version (alpha =.93). The SPQ was significantly correlated with the SensOR across groups (r = -.46) and within the ASC (r = -.49) and control group (r = -.21). Conclusions: The SPQ shows good internal consistency and concurrent validity and differentiates between adults with and without ASC. Adults with ASC report more sensitivity to sensory stimuli on the SPQ. Finally, greater sensory sensitivity is associated with more autistic traits. The SPQ provides a new tool to measure individual differences on this dimension. © 2014 Tavassoli et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {A number of studies in recent years have investigated the dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) mechanism in computer games to automatically tailor gaming experience to individual players characteristics. Although most of these existing works focus on game adaptation based on players performance, affective state experienced by the players could play a key role in gaming experience and may provide a useful indicator for a DDA mechanism. In this article, an affect-based DDA was designed and implemented for computer games. In this DDA mechanism, a players physiological signals were analyzed to infer his or her probable anxiety level, which was chosen as the target affective state, and the game difficulty level was automatically adjusted in real time as a function of the players affective state. Peripheral physiological signals were measured through wearable biofeedback sensors and several physiological indices were explored to determine their correlations with anxiety. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the affect-based DDA on game play by comparing it with a performance-based DDA. This is the first time, that is known, that the impact of a real-time affect-based DDA has been demonstrated experimentally.},

Within this main objective, a subset of two additional goals was identified: first, to analyze whether the sense of presence would differ across emotionally charged VEs, and second, to examine the link between a more objective measure of affective arousal, electrodermal activity (EDA), and presence. Following a between-subject design, 120 students were randomly assigned to one of the five VEs. Results show that almost all of the five virtual park scenarios were able to elicit the intended emotion. Additionally, presence levels were the same across all VEs suggesting that presence did not confound the emotional reaction to the VEs. Furthermore, EDA seems to be a poor indicator of presence as it is not significantly correlated with self-reported presence. The implications of these findings for both future research and practice are addressed in a comprehensive discussion.},

In particular, this study examined the impact of social presence on visitor experience in the mixed (VR \& AR) environment by applying social presence theory and experience economy theory. Questionnaires administered to 163 museum visitors revealed that social presence in mixed (VR \& AR) environments is a strong predictor of four realms of experience economy. Furthermore, all aspects of experience economy, except for esthetic experience, have a significant influence on visitor experience, which consequently induce the tourists’ intention to revisit Geevor museum. The results of this study provide theoretical and managerial implications for adoption of VR \& AR technologies in museum.},

VR is argued to offer particular benefits for children on the autism spectrum, chiefly because it can offer simulations of authentic real-world situations in a carefully controlled and safe environment. Given the real world social difficulties experienced by children on the spectrum, this technology has therefore been argued to offer distinct advantages and benefits for social and life skills training compared to other approaches. Whilst there has been some progress in testing the relevance and applicability of VR for children on the autism spectrum in educational contexts, there remains a significant challenge in developing robust and usable technologies that can really make a difference in real world classrooms.

The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of outcomes associated with VR psychological interventions and to examine the methodological rigour used in these interventions. Literature search was conducted via Ovid, ProQuest Psychology Journals and ScienceDirect (Psychology) databases. Interventions were required to: be published between 1980 to 2014; use a randomised controlled trial design; be published in a scholarly journal; focused primarily on psychological/behavioural intervention; include validated measures; include reported means and standard deviations of outcome measures; and include one group with clinical/subclinical disorders, syndromes or distressing behaviours. Thirty eligible studies were identified. Random effects meta-analysis found an overall moderate effect size for VR interventions. Individual meta-analyses found an overall large effect size against non-intervention wait-lists and an overall moderate effect size against active interventions. No correlation was found between treatment outcomes and methodological rigour. Limitations may include limited study numbers, the use of a single coder, a need for more in-depth analyses of variation in form VR intervention, and omission of presence as a moderating factor. The current review supports VR interventions as efficacious, promising forms of psychological treatment. Use of reporting guidelines such as the CONSORT and CONSORT-EHEALTH statements should promote greater emphasis on methodological rigour, providing a firm foundation for the further development of clinical VR applications.},

	abstract = {The search for genes involved in autism spectrum conditions (ASC) may have been hindered by the assumption that the different symptoms that define the condition can be attributed to the same causal mechanism. Instead the social and nonsocial aspects of ASC may have distinct causes at genetic, cognitive, and neural levels. It has been posited that the core features of ASC can be explained by a deficit in empathizing alongside intact or superior systemizing; the drive to understand and derive rules about a system. First-degree relatives also show some mild manifestations that parallel the defining features of ASC, termed the broader autism phenotype. Factor analyses were conducted to assess whether the latent structure of empathizing, systemizing, and autistic traits differs across samples with a high (individuals on the spectrum), medium (first-degree relatives) or low (general population controls) genetic vulnerability to autism. Results highlighted a two-factor model, confirming an empathizing and a systemizing factor. The relationship between these two factors was significantly stronger in first-degree relatives and the autism group compared with controls. The same model provided the best fit among the three groups, suggesting a similar latent structure irrespective of genetic vulnerability. However, results also suggest that although these traits are relatively independent in the general population, they are substantially correlated in individuals with ASC and their parents. This implies that there is substantially more overlap between systemizing and empathizing among individuals with an increased genetic liability to autism. This has potential implications for the genetic, environmental, and cognitive explanations of autism spectrum conditions.},

In the current review it is argued that the evidence for this assumption is scarce: the very great majority of RIBA research has not been intended for or suited to its examination. In fact only three studies are fit to address directly the question of the relationship between social-communication impairment and RIBAs, and these contradict each other. In consequence, further relevant evidence was sought in the behavioural and genetic literature.

	abstract = {The Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) is a self-report measure of autistic traits. It is frequently cited in diverse fields and has been administered to adults of at least average intelligence with autism and to nonclinical controls, as well as to clinical control groups such as those with schizophrenia, prosopagnosia, anorexia, and depression. However, there has been no empirical systematic review of the AQ since its inception in 2001. The present study reports a comprehensive systematic review of the literature to estimate a reliable mean AQ score in individuals without a diagnosis of an autism spectrum condition (ASC), in order to establish a reference norm for future studies. A systematic search of computerized databases was performed to identify studies that administered the AQ to nonclinical participant samples representing the adult male and female general population. Inclusion was based on a set of formalized criteria that evaluated the quality of the study, the usage of the AQ, and the population being assessed. After selection, 73 articles, detailing 6,934 nonclinical participants, as well as 1,963 matched clinical cases of ASC (from available cohorts within each individual study), were analyzed. Mean AQ score for the nonclinical population was 16.94 (95\% CI 11.6, 20.0), while mean AQ score for the clinical population with ASC was found to be 35.19 (95\% CI 27.6, 41.1). In addition, in the nonclinical population, a sex difference in autistic traits was found, although no sex difference in AQ score was seen in the clinical ASC population. These findings have implications for the study of autistic traits in the general population. Here, we confirm previous norms with more rigorous data and for the first time establish average AQ scores based on a systematic review, for populations of adult males and females with and without ASC. Finally, we advise future researchers to avoid risk of bias by carefully considering the recruitment strategy for both clinical and nonclinical groups and to demonstrate transparency by reporting recruitment methods for all participants.},

We examine correlations between the AQ and age, sex, occupation, and UK geographic region in 450,394 individuals. We predicted that age and geography would not be correlated with AQ, whilst sex and occupation would have a correlation. Mean AQ for the total sample score was m = 19.83 (SD = 8.71), slightly higher than a previous systematic review of 6,900 individuals in a non-clinical sample (mean of means = 16.94) This likely reflects that this big-data sample includes individuals with autism who in the systematic review score much higher (mean of means = 35.19). As predicted, sex and occupation differences were observed: on average, males (m = 21.55, SD = 8.82) scored higher than females (m = 18.95; SD = 8.52), and individuals working in a STEM career (m = 21.92, SD = 8.92) scored higher than individuals non-STEM careers (m = 18.92, SD = 8.48). Also as predicted, age and geographic region were not meaningfully correlated with AQ. These results support previous findings relating to sex and STEM careers in the largest set of individuals for which AQ scores have been reported and suggest the AQ is a useful self-report measure of autistic traits.},

	abstract = {Given the heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder, an important limitation of much autism spectrum disorder research is that outcome measures are statistically modeled as separate dependent variables. Often, their multivariate structure is either ignored or treated as a nuisance. This study aims to lift this limitation by applying network analysis to explicate the multivariate pattern of risk and success factors for subjective well-being in autism spectrum disorder. We estimated a network structure for 27 potential factors in 2341 individuals with autism spectrum disorder to assess the centrality of specific life domains and their importance for well-being. The data included both self- and proxy-reported information. We identified social satisfaction and societal contribution as the strongest direct paths to subjective well-being. The results suggest that an important contribution to well-being lies in resources that allow the individual to engage in social relations, which influence well-being directly. Factors most important in determining the network’s structure include self-reported IQ, living situation, level of daily activity, and happiness. Number of family members with autism spectrum disorder and openness about one’s diagnosis are least important of all factors for subjective well-being. These types of results can serve as a roadmap for interventions directed at improving the well-being of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the network approach to psychopathology has been advanced as an alternative way of conceptualizing mental disorders. In this approach, mental disorders arise from direct interactions between symptoms. Although the network approach has led to many novel methodologies and substantive applications, it has not yet been fully articulated as a scientific theory of mental disorders. The present paper aims to develop such a theory, by postulating a limited set of theoretical principles regarding the structure and dynamics of symptom networks. At the heart of the theory lies the notion that symptoms of psychopathology are causally connected through myriads of biological, psychological and societal mechanisms. If these causal relations are sufficiently strong, symptoms can generate a level of feedback that renders them self-sustaining. In this case, the network can get stuck in a disorder state. The network theory holds that this is a general feature of mental disorders, which can therefore be understood as alternative stable states of strongly connected symptom networks. This idea naturally leads to a comprehensive model of psychopathology, encompassing a common explanatory model for mental disorders, as well as novel definitions of associated concepts such as mental health, resilience, vulnerability and liability. In addition, the network theory has direct implications for how to understand diagnosis and treatment, and suggests a clear agenda for future research in psychiatry and associated disciplines.},

A large sample of British adolescent participants (n ¼ 1004) aged 14 and 15 years and an equal number of their carers were interviewed. Young people provided reports of their recent gaming experiences. Further, the violent contents of these games were coded using official EU and US ratings, and carers provided evaluations of their adolescents' aggressive behaviours in the past month. Following a preregistered analysis plan, multiple regression analyses tested the hypothesis that recent violent game play is linearly and positively related to carer assessments of aggressive behaviour. Results did not support this prediction, nor did they support the idea that the relationship between these factors follows a nonlinear parabolic function. There was no evidence for a critical tipping point relating violent game engagement to aggressive behaviour. Sensitivity and exploratory analyses indicated these null effects extended across multiple operationalizations of violent game engagement and when the focus was on another behavioural outcome, namely, prosocial behaviour. The discussion presents an interpretation of this pattern of effects in terms of both the ongoing scientific and policy debates around violent video games, and emerging standards for robust evidence-based policy concerning young people's technology use.},

	abstract = {A phenomenological study was conducted to investigate the social experiences and perceptions of friendship among three adolescents with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) engaged in online videogame play in the context of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Semi-structured interviews with three participants, diagnosed with ASD between the ages of 16 –21 years, yielded four themes that illustrated the social experiences of participants in this study. Emerging themes and participant comments identified in this study parallel those identified in the most recent research literature that has also sought to identify experiences and attributes that may lead to successful interpersonal relationships for individuals identified with ASD. Participants in this study articulated the desire to socialize, interact, and frequently communicate in a virtual environment; challenges with being misunderstood; issues with identification and perceptions of friends; and awareness of rules specific to face-to-face and virtual environments. A review of the current research literature related to adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) revealed a focus on adoles-cent social challenges and language develop-ment as well as strategies to increase the ac-quisition of functional social skills. However, there was a notable absence of research on the social and relational impact of the use of vir-tual environments and online gaming for in-dividuals with ASD. The focus of this study was the examination of the social interactions of adolescents with ASD as they engaged in mas-sively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG). This article begins by providing context for the development of the study rationale through a review of the extant literature on individuals with ASD and participation in vir-tual environments and online gaming. Next the study's purpose is connected to the docu-mented social and relational needs of individ-uals with ASD and the potential of virtual environments and online gaming to meet those needs. A description of the research study and methodology follows along with a summary of results and implications for indi-viduals with ASD. Concluding remarks ad-dress the potential implications of an ex-panded research effort in this area on the postsecondary outcomes of adolescents and young adults with ASD.},

	abstract = {Background Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network). Methods We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction. Results Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD. Conclusions Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD.},

	abstract = {Background: Neurobiological research in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has paid little attention on brain mechanisms that cause and maintain restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBIs). Evidence indicates an imbalance in the brain's reward system responsiveness to social and non-social stimuli may contribute to both social deficits and RRBIs. Thus, this study's central aim was to compare brain responsiveness to individual RRBI (i.e., circumscribed interests), with social rewards (i.e., social approval), in youth with ASD relative to typically developing controls (TDCs). Methods: We conducted a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent effect of personalized circumscribed interest rewards versus social rewards in 39 youth with ASD relative to 22 TDC. To probe the reward system, we employed short video clips as reinforcement in an instrumental incentive delay task. This optimization increased the task's ecological validity compared to still pictures that are often used in this line of research. Results: Compared to TDCs, youth with ASD had stronger reward system responses for CIs mostly within the non-social realm (e.g., video games) than social rewards (e.g., approval). Additionally, this imbalance within the caudate nucleus' responsiveness was related to greater social impairment. Conclusions: The current data support the idea of reward system dysfunction that may contribute to enhanced motivation for RRBIs in ASD, accompanied by diminished motivation for social engagement. If a dysregulated reward system indeed supports the emergence and maintenance of social and non-social symptoms of ASD, then strategically targeting the reward system in future treatment endeavors may allow for more efficacious treatment practices that help improve outcomes for individuals with ASD and their families.},

The study used survey data from players of World of Warcraft (WoW), a popular MMO game. The indicators of psychosocial problems were high stress and low self-esteem and the motivation was escapism. The empirical analysis investigated interaction effects between indicators of psychosocial well-being and motivations. It was hypothesized that the relationship between escapism and negative outcomes would be positive for individuals with high stress or low self-esteem, which would be indicative of escapist online gaming as a coping strategy. However, this was only expected for individuals who experience more negative outcomes from their online gaming, which would highlight an important difference between those who experience many problems and those who experience few. The results showed that both stress and self-esteem moderated the relationship between escapism and negative outcomes as expected. In both cases, the relationship between escapism and negative outcomes was positive in the presence of more psychosocial problems (i.e. high stress or low self-esteem) for those who experience many negative outcomes, but not for those who experience few. The results support the theory of compensatory internet use and suggest that excessive online gaming may be a coping strategy for life problems rather than a mental disorder as proposed in DSM-V. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This study uses well-established, basic learning theory to clarify the concept of escapism, and examines its relation to problematic gaming, psychological distress, and satisfaction with life among players of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs). MMORPG players (n=201) answered an online questionnaire where these factors were measured and correlated with a previously developed scale on motivation to play (MTPI), including extra items to cover positive and negative aspects of escapism. Factor analysis and construct validation show that positive aspects of escapism are theoretically and empirically unstable and that escapism is best clarified as purely "negative escapism," corresponding to playing being negatively reinforced as a way of avoiding everyday hassles and distress. Negative escapism had a stronger relationship to symptoms of Internet addiction, psychological distress, and life satisfaction than other variables and other more positive motivations to play. Future studies should use the revised subscale for escapism (in the MTPI-R) presented in the present study, for example when screening for Internet addiction.},

	abstract = {Video games continue to be a highly popular form of entertainment. In 2003, over 239 million computer and video games were sold in the United States, and the video game industry reported sales of over \$7 billion (Entertainment Software Association, 2004). According to an industry poll conducted by ESA (2004), 50\% of U.S.-Americans play video games, the average age is 29, and 39\% of players are female. An Annenberg Public Policy Center survey (Woodard \& Gridina, 2000) estimates that video game consoles are in 68\% of U.S.-American homes with at least one 2-to 17-year-old and in 75\% of homes with two or more children. These figures are expected to grow as high-speed broadband Internet access facilitates networked game play. Clearly, video games have emerged as one of the most popular forms of mass mediated entertainment in the United States among a range of people. Despite this popularity, the study of video games is still in its infancy. To date, most video game studies have focused on traditional effects issues, particularly the effects of violent video games on aggression (see Anderson \& Bushman, 2001; Funk, 1992; MediaScope, 1996; Sherry, 2001a). Many of the questions found in Chaffee's (1977) 18-cell explication of media effects have gone largely unaddressed. Prominent among these questions are the reasons why people use video games and the gratifications that they receive from them. In this chapter, we explore the reasons that individuals use video games and how those reasons are translated into genre preferences and amount of time devoted to game play from a uses and gratifications perspective.},

Recently, and despite inconsistencies in classification and limited data regarding the etiology of the condition, Internet gaming disorder has been included in Sect. 3 (research appendix) of the DSM-5. The focus of the current chapter was the dysfunctional involvement in a specific type of video game which has some inherent characteristics reinforcing its addictive nature: Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs). MMORPGs are indeed one of the most recent and popular types of video games played worldwide, and problematic and uncontrolled involvement in playing MMORPGs is the most frequently reported activity by people seeking help for an Internet-related problem. In this chapter, we first described the specific structural characteristics of MMORPGs themselves (e.g., permanent world, reinforcement schedule, advancement systems, interface favoring social exchanges) and explained how they can increase their “addictive potential”. Then, the main psychological factors (motives to play, impulsivity traits) were reviewed alongside neurobiological features (e.g., changes in neural circuitry involved in controlled regulation of behavior and reward drive) related to the development and maintenance of MMORPG addiction. The few available studies having tested the efficacy of treatments targeting Internet and video game addictions were also briefly considered. Limitations of existing data are emphasized, and avenues for further research proposed (both at the theoretical and clinical levels).},

Participants completed the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire and the Autism Spectrum Quotient. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on the data. Responses to the open questions were analyzed as part of this study, and the closed questionnaire data have been reported elsewhere. Data were coded and responses quantitatively compared by group. In addition, data were qualitatively analyzed using a general inductive approach, which resulted in two themes: “problematic sensory experiences” and “calming sensory experiences.” Results show that coping mechanisms and certain aspects of the sensory experience vary according to autistic trait level, and provide insight into the nature of sensory reactivity across the general population.},

We reviewed the available literature on serious games that are used to teach social interactions to individuals with ASD. After screening the Medline, Science Direct and ACM Digital Library databases, we found a total of 31 serious games: 16 that targeted emotion recognition or production and 15 that targeted social skills. There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible. Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning ASD individuals.},

	abstract = {Language change is a complex social phenomenon, revealing pathways of communication and sociocultural influence. But, while language change has long been a topic of study in sociolinguistics, traditional linguistic research methods rely on circumstantial evidence, estimating the direction of change from differences between older and younger speakers. In this paper, we use a data set of several million Twitter users to track language changes in progress. First, we show that language change can be viewed as a form of social influence: we observe complex contagion for phonetic spellings and "netspeak" abbreviations (e.g., lol), but not for older dialect markers from spoken language. Next, we test whether specific types of social network connections are more influential than others, using a parametric Hawkes process model. We find that tie strength plays an important role: densely embedded social ties are significantly better conduits of linguistic influence. Geographic locality appears to play a more limited role: we find relatively little evidence to support the hypothesis that individuals are more influenced by geographically local social ties, even in their usage of geographical dialect markers.},

Several psychological factors have been shown to influence the development and the maintenance of this problematic behavior, including impulsivity traits, motives to play (immersion, achievement, social affiliation), and self-esteem. The aim of the current study is to determine whether reliable subtypes of problematic online gamers can be identified. A sample of 1057 online gamers was recruited. Validated questionnaires were used to measure established psychological risk factors (impulsivity, motives to play, self-esteem) and potential consequences of playing (addiction symptoms, positive and negative affect). Actual in-game behaviors were also monitored. Five reliable clusters of gamers were identified (three problematic and two nonproblematic clusters). Cluster comparison revealed that the psychological factors considered are differentially involved in problematic online gaming. At the theoretical level, the results emphasized that problem online gaming depends on a wide range of psychological factors. At the clinical level, the diversity of psychological profiles shown supports the development of personalized (custom-made) interventions targeting specific psychological mechanisms. Overall, our findings suggest that conceptualizing the problematic use of massively multiplayer online role-playing games as "behavioral addiction" is too restrictive and might result in the simplification of heterogeneous and multi-determined problematic behaviors.},

After they played the game, we assessed three aggression-related outcome variables (aggressive behavior, aggressive-thought accessibility, and aggressive affect). Results showed strong evidence that adults with ASD, compared with typically developing adults, are not differentially affected by acute exposure to violent video games. Moreover, model comparisons provided modest evidence against any effect of violent game content whatsoever. Findings from this experiment suggest that societal concerns that exposure to violent games may have a unique effect on adults with autism are not supported by evidence.},

Rather than viewing such processes as either nonexistent or as automatic, I argue that they are dynamic and dependent upon social-contextual supports pertaining to basic human psychological needs. To develop this viewpoint, I conceptually link the notion of integrative tendencies to specific developmental processes, namely intrinsic motivation; internalization; and emotional integration. These processes are then shown to be facilitated by conditions that fulfill psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, and forestalled within contexts that frustrate these needs. Interactions between psychological needs and contextual supports account, in part, for the domain and situational specificity of motivation, experience, and relative integration. The meaning of psychological needs (vs. wants) is directly considered, as are the relations between concepts of integration and autonomy and those of independence, individualism, efficacy, and cognitive models of "multiple selves."},

	abstract = {A preoccupation with restricted interests (RI) is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Engagement in RI is commonly observed in this population and impacts social, adaptive, and emotional functioning. The presence of anxiety disorders and overlap in symptom expression with RI, such as obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), in children with ASD suggests a possible link between anxiety and the RI manifestation. RI play a multidimensional role in ASD and have been described as being expressed in multiple forms, such as fact collection or the enactment of RI through play. However, there is little research exploring in more detail the possible relationship between RI expression and anxiety. To explore the association between RI expression and anxiety, the current study examined the association between the various modes of RI expression and anxiety disorder symptoms in 68 elementary-aged children diagnosed with high-functioning ASD. Findings indicated that symbolic enactment of RI in the form of play, rather than information collection or time engaged in RI, was significantly linked with the increased presence and severity of anxiety symptoms. The conceptualization of RI as possible maladaptive coping responses to negative emotional experiences is discussed. © The Author(s) 2012.},

	abstract = {Adolescence is a unique developmental period, characterized by physical and emotional growth and significant maturation of cognitive and social skills. For individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), it is also a vulnerable period as cognitive and social skills can deteriorate. Circumscribed interests (CIs), idiosyncratic areas of intense interest and focus, are a core symptom of ASD that may be associated with social development. Yet, relatively little is known about the expression of CIs in adolescents with ASD. Many studies investigating CIs have used images depicting items of special interest; however, it is not clear how images should be customized for adolescent studies. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the types of images that may be appropriate for studies of CIs in adolescents with ASD. To this end, we used a mixed methods design that included, 1) one-on-one interviews with 10 adolescents (4 with ASD and 6 TD), to identify categories of images that were High Autism Interest ('HAI') or High Typically Developing Interest ('HTD'), and 2) an online survey taken by fifty-three adolescents with ASD (42 male) and 135 typically developing (TD) adolescents (55 male) who rated how much they liked 105 'HAI' and 'HTD' images. Although we found a significant interaction between 'HAI' and 'HTD' categories and diagnosis, neither group significantly preferred one category over the other, and only one individual category ('Celebrities') showed a significant group effect, favored by TD adolescents. Males significantly preferred 'HAI' images relative to females, and TD adolescents significantly preferred images with social content relative to adolescents with ASD. Our findings suggest that studies investigating affective or neural responses to CI-related stimuli in adolescents should consider that stereotypical ASD interests (e.g. trains, gadgets) may not accurately represent individual adolescents with ASD, many of whom show interests that overlap with TD adolescents (e.g. video games).},

Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 30 undergraduate men enrolled in one of four undergraduate sport-degree programs at one uni-versity in the United Kingdom, we find these heterosexual men to be less reliant on traditional homosocial boundaries, which have previously limited male same-sex friendships. Contrary to the repressive homosociality of the 1980s and 1990s, these men embrace a significantly more inclusive, tac-tile, and emotionally diverse approach to their homosocial relationships. All participants provided comparable defini-tions of what a bromance is and how it operates, all had at least one bromantic friend, and all suggested that bromances had more to offer than a standard friendship. Participants de-scribed a bromance as being more emotionally intimate, phys-ically demonstrative, and based upon unrivalled trust and co-hesion compared to their other friendships. Participants used their experiences with romances and familial relations as a reference point for considering the conditions of a bromance. Results support the view that declining homophobia and its internalization has had significantly positive implications for male expression and intimacy. Conclusions are made about the bromance's potential to improve men's mental health and social well-being because participants indicate these rela-tionships provide a space for emotional disclosure and the discussion of potentially traumatic and sensitive issues.},

Ninety-one adolescents with an ASD and their parents completed mail-based surveys during the summer months. Adolescents with an ASD identified more friends than did their parents, but they agreed on the friends' characteristics. About half of the adolescents spent an average of 4 hours per day with friends during the summer months. Male adolescents with an ASD most frequently played video games with friends, whereas females most frequently had conversations with friends. The findings suggest that adolescents with an ASD and their parents identify different peers as the adolescent's friends.

This study had two major aims: (1) to provide a detailed characterization of repetitive behaviors in individuals with Asperger Syndrome (AS), high-functioning autism (HFA), and typically developing controls (TD); and (2) to examine whether differences in repetitive behavior profiles could provide evidence for the external validity of AS separate from HFA. Specifically, it was hypothesized that circumscribed interests would be more prevalent and cause more impairment in the AS group than the HFA group, while the reverse would be true for other categories of repetitive behavior. The parent(s) of 61 children and adolescents (19 with AS, 21 with HFA, and 21 TD) completed two interviews focused specifically on lifetime and current repetitive behavior symptoms. No reliable differences in repetitive behavior between AS and HFA children were found. Results suggested that circumscribed interests differ in developmental course from the three other DSM-IV-TR categories of repetitive behavior. Internal consistency among the four DSM-IV-TR categories of repetitive behavior was high, alpha = .84, providing evidence for a unitary repetitive behaviors factor. The importance of expanding research in the repetitive behavior domain is highlighted as part of the necessary integration of behavioral and neurobiological approaches to understanding the etiology of autism.},

The Interests Scale, a parent-rating questionnaire, and the Interview for Repetitive Behaviors, a semi-structured interview, were used to assess CI. Groups did not differ on the number of interests children held, but they did differ on types of interests and impairment associated with them. The interests of ASD participants were more likely to be nonsocial in nature (e.g. mechanical systems) than TD participants. Parents of children with ASD endorsed higher degrees of functional impairment on metrics including frequency, interference, resistance when interrupted, flexibility, and accommodation required, as well as less involvement of other people, than parents of children with TD. These findings suggest that interests of individuals with ASD differ qualitatively and in intensity from individuals with TD. The present study offers further support for the notion that CI reflect a clinically significant feature of ASD that warrants intervention in some children.},

Unfortunately, for some 30\% of individuals with autism, there is marked decline in adaptive functioning during adolescence. We propose a two-hit model of autism. First, early perturbations in neural development function as a “first hit” that sets up a neural system that is “built to fail” in the face of a second hit. Second, the confluence of pubertal hormones, neural reorganization, and increasing social demands during adolescence provides the “second hit” that interferes with the ability to transition into adult social roles and levels of adaptive functioning. In support of this model, we review evidence about adolescent-specific neural and behavioral development in autism. We conclude with predictions and recommendations for empirical investigation about several domains in which developmental trajectories for individuals with autism may be uniquely deterred in adolescence.},

Many adults on the autism spectrum fare poorly across a wide range of quality of life indicators. Understanding the multilevel factors that influence transition outcomes is necessary to develop strategies that promote better outcomes. In this scoping review, we characterize the use of social-ecological factors in adult autism outcome studies, identify understudied areas of research, and provide recommendations for future research. We conducted a literature search for studies in which the relationship between social-ecological factors and transition outcomes among transition-age youth with autism was assessed. We organized variables used in studies across 5 levels of influence: Family-, interpersonal-, institutional-, community-, and policy-level factors. Our findings reveal that both breadth and depth of social-ecological factors usage in autism outcomes studies is limited because of the narrow inclusion of variables across social-ecological levels, the overreliance on a limited number of national data sets, and the overall lack of variation in research design. We propose 9 recommendations to inform the development of multilevel studies. Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics. All rights reserved.},

In order to develop a framework for such collaborative working, a UK seminar series was organised and co-produced by autistic and non-autistic people with academic, practitioner and lived expertise. This article reports on the outcomes from the series, identifying five topics relevant to building a community of practice in participatory research: Respect, Authenticity, Assumptions, Infrastructure and Empathy. Each topic is connected to a specific example from within and beyond research, to inspire new practices in the field. We call for the development of participatory research skills among the autism research community and the facilitation of greater autistic leadership of, and partnership in, research. Such work, if delivered to a high standard, is likely to lead to better translation into practice and improved outcomes for autistic people and those who support them.},

	abstract = {The factor mixture model (FMM) uses a hybrid of both categorical and continuous latent variables. The FMM is a good model for the underlying structure of psychopathology because the use of both categorical and continuous latent variables allows the structure to be simultaneously categorical and dimensional. This is useful because both diagnostic class membership and the range of severity within and across diagnostic classes can be modeled concurrently. Although the conceptualization of the FMM has been explained in the literature, the use of the FMM is still not prevalent. One reason is that there is little research about how such models should be applied in practice and, once a well-fitting model is obtained, how it should be interpreted. In this article, the FMM is explored by studying a real data example on conduct disorder. By exploring this example, this article aims to explain the different formulations of the FMM, the various steps in building a FMM, and how to decide between an FMM and alternative models. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

More generally, this model can be seen as a combination of latent class modeling and conventional mixture modeling. The EM algorithm is used for estimation. As an illustration, a random-coefficient growth model for the prediction of alcohol dependence from three latent classes of heavy alcohol use trajectories among young adults is analyzed.},

	abstract = {This study examines whether sensory differences can be used to classify meaningful subgroups of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Caregivers of children with ASD aged 2-10 years (n=228) completed the Short Sensory Profile. Model-based cluster analysis was used to extract sensory subtypes. The relationship of these subtypes to age, gender, autism symptom severity, and nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) was further explored. Four distinct sensory subtypes were identified: (a) sensory adaptive; (b) taste smell sensitive; (c) postural inattentive; and (d) generalized sensory difference. The sensory subtypes differ from each other on two dimensions: (a) the severity of reported sensory differences; and (b) the focus of differences across auditory, taste, smell, vestibular and proprioceptive domains. Examination of the clinical features of each subtype reveals two possible mechanisms of sensory disturbance in autism: (a) sensory hyperreactivity; and (b) difficulties with multisensory processing. Further, the sensory subtypes are not well explained by other variables such as age, gender, IQ, and autism symptom severity. We conclude that classification of children using sensory differences offers a promising method by which to identify phenotypes in ASD. Sensory-based phenotypes may be useful in identifying behavioral features responsive to specific interventions thereby improving intervention effectiveness. Further validation of the sensory-based phenotypes by establishing neural and physiological correlates is recommended.

	abstract = {Recent reports identify sensory subtypes in ASD based on shared patterns of responses to daily sensory stimuli [Ausderau et al., 2014; Lane, Molloy, \& Bishop, 2014]. Lane et al. propose that two broad sensory dimensions, sensory reactivity and multisensory integration, best explain the differences between subtypes, however this has yet to be tested. The present study tests this hypothesis by examining the latent constructs underlying Lane's sensory subtypes. Participants for this study were caregivers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) aged 2–12 years. Caregiver responses on the Short Sensory Profile (SSP), used to establish Lane's sensory subtypes, were extracted from two existing datasets (total n = 287). Independent component analyses were conducted to test the fit and interpretability of a two-construct structure underlying the SSP, and therefore, the sensory subtypes. The first construct was largely comprised of the taste/smell sensitivity domain, which describes hyper-reactivity to taste and smell stimuli. The second construct had a significant contribution from the low energy/weak domain, which describes behaviors that may be indicative of difficulties with multisensory integration. Findings provide initial support for our hypothesis that sensory reactivity and multisensory integration underlie Lane's sensory subtypes in ASD.

For scientific research and the clinical practice, one needs reliable and valid questionnaires that measure sensory sensitivity and can distinguish between hypo- and hyper-responsiveness. We translated the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire into Dutch. The aim was to examine the psychometric properties and the clinical use of the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire in 78 autistic and 68 typically developing adults (18–45 years; IQ {\textgreater} 70). Just like the original Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire, the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is a reliable and valid questionnaire. The Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire had reliable hypo- and hyper-responsiveness subscales, reasonable to good modality subscales and was stable over time. Moreover, using the 95th percentile of the typically developing group as cut-off, we showed that two thirds of the autistic adults had heightened sensory sensitivity. We also showed that hypo- and hyper-responsiveness do co-exist in both autistic and typically developing adults. In sum, we conclude that the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is suitable to be used in scientific research as well as in the clinical practice.},

Nonetheless, its psychometric validity is yet to be justified. This study tested the factor structure of the AQ by means of principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis using, for the first time, data from 4192 Taiwanese parents (1208 with ASD children and 2984 with typically developing children). Results yielded a 35-item, 5-dimensional factor solution that had favorable psychometric characteristics (RMSEA = .054; NNFI = .962; CFI = .969) than any of the previously-published AQ factor solutions. Subscales of this new AQ-Chinese model were statistically and semantically coherent, namely: Socialness, Mindreading, Patterns, Attention to Details and Attention Switching. The psychometric properties of the AQ-Chinese did not change between clinic-based and community-based data suggesting good fitting for a continuum of autistic expression. Furthermore, the considerable overlap between the AQ-Chinese and the AQ factor structures derived previously using student samples indicated consistency in the manifestation of the autistic profile across different cultures and age groups. Group differences in the AQ-Chinese scores were in line with previous studies, i.e. males generally scored radically higher than females except in Attention to Details. Interestingly, mothers of ASD children reported lower total AQ scores than community mothers yet no significant group difference for the fathers. Important research and clinical implications pertinent to parents with children with ASD and the utility of the AQ were drawn. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Autism research is heavily skewed toward western high-income countries. Culturally appropriate screening and diagnostic instruments for autism are lacking in most low- and middle-income settings where the majority of the global autism population lives. To date, a clear overview of the possible cultural and contextual factors that may affect the process of identifying and diagnosing individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is missing. This study aims to outline these factors by proposing a conceptual framework. A multidisciplinary review approach was applied to inform the development of the conceptual framework, combining a systematic review of the relevant autism research literature with a wider literature search spanning key texts in global mental health, cultural psychiatry, cross-cultural psychology, and intellectual disability research. The resulting conceptual framework considers the identification, help-seeking, and diagnostic process at four interrelated levels: (a) the expression; (b) recognition; (c) interpretation; and (d) reporting of autism symptoms, and describes the cultural and contextual factors associated with each of these levels, including cultural norms of typical and atypical behavior, culture-specific approaches to parenting, mental health literacy, cultural beliefs, attitudes and stigma, as well as the affordability, availability, accessibility, and acceptability of services. This framework, mapping out the cultural and contextual factors that can affect the identification, help-seeking, and diagnosis of ASD may function as a springboard for the development of culturally appropriate autism screening and diagnostic instruments, and inform future cross-cultural autism research directions. The framework also has relevance for clinicians and policy makers aiming to improve support for underserved autism populations worldwide. LAY SUMMARY: The vast majority of autism research is conducted in western high-income settings. We therefore know relatively little of how culture and context can affect the identification, help-seeking, and diagnosis of autism across the globe. This study synthesizes what is known from the autism research literature and a broader literature and maps out how culture and context may affect (a) the expression, (b) recognition, (c) interpretation, and (d) reporting of autism symptoms. © 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Results indicate that Israeli parents reported unusual responses to sensory experiences less frequently than U.S. parents for both ASD and typically developing children. U.S. children with ASD demonstrated significantly greater difficulty in the Auditory Filtering and Visual/Auditory Sensitivity domains than Israeli children with ASD.

The innovative network approach aims to further our understanding of mental disorders by focusing on meaningful connections between individual symptoms of a disorder and has thus far proven valuable insights to psychopathology. The aims of current study were to I) construct a symptom network and investigate interactions between a wide array of psychotic symptoms; II) identify the most important symptoms within this network and III) perform an explorative shortest pathway analysis between depressive and delusional symptoms. We analyzed interview data from n = 408 male patients with non-affective psychosis using the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History (CASH). A network structure of 79 symptoms was computed to explore partial correlations between positive, negative, catatonia and affective symptoms. The resulting network showed strong connectivity between individual symptoms of the CASH, both within- and between-domains. Most central symptoms included ‘loss of interest’, ‘chaotic speech’, ‘inability to enjoy recreational interest in activities’, ‘inability to form or maintain relationships with friends’ and ‘poverty of content of speech’. The shortest pathway analysis between depressive and delusional symptoms displayed an important role for ‘persecutory delusions’. In conclusion, this study showed that individual psychotic symptoms are meaningfully related to each other not only within their own cluster, but also between different clusters and that important information may be acquired by investigating interactions at a symptom level.},

	abstract = {A foundational question for the discipline of psychiatry is the nature of psychiatric disorders. What kinds of things are they? In this paper, I review and critique three major relevant theories: realism, pragmatism and constructivism. Realism assumes that the content of science is real and independent of human activities. I distinguish two "flavors" of realism: chemistry-based, for which the paradigmatic example is elements of the periodic table, and biology-based, for which the paradigm is species. The latter is a much better fit for psychiatry. Pragmatism articulates a sensible approach to psychiatric disorders just seeking categories that perform well in the world. But it makes no claim about the reality of those disorders. This is problematic, because we have a duty to advocate for our profession and our patients against other physicians who never doubt the reality of the disorders they treat. Constructivism has been associated with anti-psychiatry activists, but we should admit that social forces play a role in the creation of our diagnoses, as they do in many sciences. However, truly socially constructed psychiatric disorders are rare. I then describe powerful arguments against a realist theory of psychiatric disorders. Because so many prior psychiatric diagnoses have been proposed and then abandoned, can we really claim that our current nosologies have it right? Much of our current nosology arose from a series of historical figures and events which could have gone differently. If we re-run the tape of history over and over again, the DSM and ICD would not likely have the same categories on every iteration. Therefore, we should argue more confidently for the reality of broader constructs of psychiatric illness rather than our current diagnostic categories, which remain tentative. Finally, instead of thinking that our disorders are true because they correspond to clear entities in the world, we should consider a coherence theory of truth by which disorders become more true when they fit better into what else we know about the world. In our ongoing project to study and justify the nature of psychiatric disorders, we ought to be broadly pragmatic but not lose sight of an underlying commitment, despite the associated difficulties, to the reality of psychiatric illness.},

This study aimed to capture parent and teacher perspectives on how sensory differences affect learning and life at school for pupils with ASD. Method: Fifty-seven parents and seventy UK teachers completed a bespoke online questionnaire that focused on the type of sensory experiences encountered at school and how these experiences impacted learning and school life for autistic pupils. Results: Despite considerable heterogeneity in the experiences perceived as enjoyable or distressing, parents and teachers reported that sensory experiences at school were frequently negative. Data indicate that it was largely negative sensory experiences that impacted learning, in turn causing distraction, anxiety and limited participation. Although five teachers highlighted positive sensory experiences, the examples offered focused on children's ability to engage in classroom activities, once their sensory needs had been met (e.g. using weighted blankets). Factors including predictability of sensory input, school resources, and staff knowledge minimized sensory disruption. Conclusions: According to teachers and parents, sensory experiences significantly impact learning and school life for autistic pupils and these findings can inform teacher training and intervention development.},

	abstract = {Background: A considerable amount of research has discussed whether autism and psychiatric/neurodevelopmental conditions in general are best described categorically or dimensionally. In recent years, finite mixture models have been increasingly applied to mixed populations of autistic and non-autistic individuals to answer this question. However, the use of such methods with mixed populations may not be appropriate for two reasons: First, subgroups within mixed populations are often skewed and thus violate mixture models assumptions, which are based on weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. Second, these analyses have, to our knowledge, been solely applied to enriched samples, where the prevalence of the clinical condition within the study sample far exceeds epidemiological estimates. Method: We employed a dual Weibull mixture model to examine the distribution of the Autism Spectrum Quotient scores of a mixed sample of autistic and non-autistic adults (N = 4717; autism = 811), as well as of a derived sample (from the enriched sample; N = 3973; autism = 67) that reflects the current prevalence of autism within the general population. Results: In a mixed autistic and non-autistic population, our model provided a better description of the underlying structure of autistic traits than traditional finite Gaussian mixture models and performed well when applied to a sample that reflected the prevalence of autism in the general population. The model yielded results, which are consistent with predictions of current theories advocating for the co-existence of a mixed categorical and dimensional architecture within the autism spectrum. Conclusion: The results provide insight into the continuum nature of the distribution of autistic traits, support the complementary role of both categorical and dimensional approaches to autism spectrum condition, and underscore the importance of analyzing samples that reflect the epidemiological prevalence of the condition. Owing to its flexibility to represent a wide variety of distributions, the Weibull distribution might be better suited for latent structure studies, within enriched and prevalence-true samples.},

With only four parameters, the uncertainty model explains why d' is approximately a power function of contrast ("nonlinear transduction") and accurately predicts effects of summation, facilitation, noise, subjective criterion, and task for near-threshold contrast.

Internal noise has previously been estimated with the equivalent noise paradigm using broadband white noise masks and assuming a linear model. However, in addition to introducing noise into the detecting channel, white noise masks can suppress neural signals, and the linear model does not satisfactorily explain data from other paradigms. Here we propose estimating internal noise from a nonlinear gain control model fitted to contrast discrimination data. This method, and noise estimates from the equivalent noise paradigm, are compared to a direct psychophysical measure of noise (double-pass consistency) using a detailed dataset with seven observers. Additionally, contrast discrimination and double-pass paradigms were further examined with a refined set of conditions in 40 observers. We demonstrate that the gain control model produces more accurate double-pass consistency predictions than a linear model. We also show that the noise parameter is strongly related to consistency scores whereas the gain control parameter is not; a differentiation of which the equivalent noise paradigm is not capable. Lastly, we argue that both the contrast discrimination and the double-pass paradigms are sensitive measures of internal noise that can be used in the study of individual differences.},

	abstract = {The transmission of weak signals through the visual system is limited by internal noise. Its level can be estimated by adding external noise, which increases the variance within the detecting mechanism, causing masking. But experiments with white noise fail to meet three predictions: (a) noise has too small an influence on the slope of the psychometric function, (b) masking occurs even when the noise sample is identical in each two-alternative forced-choice (2AFC) interval, and (c) double-pass consistency is too low. We show that much of the energy of 2D white noise masks extends well beyond the pass-band of plausible detecting mechanisms and that this suppresses signal activity. These problems are avoided by restricting the external noise energy to the target mechanisms by introducing a pedestal with a mean contrast of 0\% and independent contrast jitter in each 2AFC interval (termed zero-dimensional [0D] noise). We compared the jitter condition to masking from 2D white noise in double-pass masking and (novel) contrast matching experiments. Zero-dimensional noise produced the strongest masking, greatest double-pass consistency, and no suppression of perceived contrast, consistent with a noisy ideal observer. Deviations from this behavior for 2D white noise were explained by cross-channel suppression with no need to appeal to induced internal noise or uncertainty. We conclude that (a) results from previous experiments using white pixel noise should be re-evaluated and (b) 0D noise provides a cleaner method for investigating internal variability than pixel noise. Ironically then, the best external noise stimulus does not look noisy. © 2012 ARVO.},

Mean response amplitudes were statistically indistinguishable across groups, yet trial-by-trial response reliability was significantly weaker in autism, yielding smaller signal-to-noise ratios in all sensory systems. Response reliability differences were evident only in evoked cortical responses and not in ongoing resting-state activity. These findings reveal that abnormally unreliable cortical responses, even to elementary nonsocial sensory stimuli, may represent a fundamental physiological alteration of neural processing in autism.

Variability in the internal determinants is commonly attributed to internal noise (often vaguely defined). We present a variety of experimental results that demonstrate observer inconsistency in performing noise-limited visual detection and discrimination tasks with repeated presentation of images. Our results can be interpreted by using a model that includes an internal-noise component that is directly proportional to image noise. This so-called induced internal-noise component dominates when external noise is easily visible. We demonstrate that decision-variable fluctuations lead to this type of internal noise. Given this induced internal-noise proportionality (sigma i/sigma 0 = 0.75 +/- 0.1), the upper limit to human visual signal-detection efficiency is 64\% +/- 6\%. This limit is consistent with a variety of results presented in earlier papers in this series.},

	abstract = {Human contrast discrimination performance is limited by transduction nonlinearities and variability of the neural representation (noise). Whereas the nonlinearities have been well-characterised, there is less agreement about the specifics of internal noise. Psychophysical models assume that it impacts late in sensory processing, whereas neuroimaging and intracranial electrophysiology studies suggest that the noise is much earlier. We investigated whether perceptually-relevant internal noise arises in early visual areas or later decision making areas. We recorded EEG and MEG during a two-interval-forced-choice contrast discrimination task and used multivariate pattern analysis to decode target/non-target and selected/non-selected intervals from evoked responses. We found that perceptual decisions could be decoded from both EEG and MEG signals, even when the stimuli in both intervals were physically identical. Above-chance decision classification started {\textless}100 ms after stimulus onset, suggesting that neural noise affects sensory signals early in the visual pathway. Classification accuracy increased over time, peaking at {\textgreater}500 ms. Applying multivariate analysis to separate anatomically-defined brain regions in MEG source space, we found that occipital regions were informative early on but then information spreads forwards across parietal and frontal regions. This is consistent with neural noise affecting sensory processing at multiple stages of perceptual decision making. We suggest how early sensory noise might be resolved with Birdsall's linearisation, in which a dominant noise source obscures subsequent nonlinearities, to allow the visual system to preserve the wide dynamic range of early areas whilst still benefitting from contrast-invariance at later stages.

	abstract = {Previous neuroimaging research has reported increased internal (neural) noise in sensory systems of autistic individuals. However, it is unclear if this difference has behavioural or perceptual consequences, as previous attempts at measuring internal noise in ASD psychophysically have been indirect. Here, we use a “gold standard” psychophysical double-pass paradigm to investigate the relationship between internal noise and autistic traits in the neurotypical population (n = 43). We measured internal noise in three tasks (contrast perception, facial expression intensity perception, and number summation) to estimate a global internal noise factor using principal components analysis. This global internal noise was positively correlated with autistic traits (rs = 0.32, P = 0.035). This suggests that increased internal noise is associated with the ASD phenotype even in subclinical populations. The finding is discussed in relation to the neural and genetic basis of internal noise in ASD.

	abstract = {Visuo-perceptual processing in autism is characterized by intact or enhanced performance on static spatial tasks and inferior performance on dynamic tasks, suggesting a deficit of dorsal visual stream processing in autism. However, previous findings by Bertone et al. indicate that neuro-integrative mechanisms used to detect complex motion, rather than motion perception per se, may be impaired in autism. We present here the first demonstration of concurrent enhanced and decreased performance in autism on the same visuo-spatial static task, wherein the only factor dichotomizing performance was the neural complexity required to discriminate grating orientation. The ability of persons with autism was found to be superior for identifying the orientation of simple, luminance-defined (or first-order) gratings but inferior for complex, texture-defined (or second-order) gratings. Using a flicker contrast sensitivity task, we demonstrated that this finding is probably not due to abnormal information processing at a sub-cortical level (magnocellular and parvocellular functioning). Together, these findings are interpreted as a clear indication of altered low-level perceptual information processing in autism, and confirm that the deficits and assets observed in autistic visual perception are contingent on the complexity of the neural network required to process a given type of visual stimulus. We suggest that atypical neural connectivity, resulting in enhanced lateral inhibition, may account for both enhanced and decreased low-level information processing in autism. © The Author (2005).

	abstract = {To judge the overall direction of a shoal of fish or a crowd of people, observers must integrate motion signals across space and time. The limits on our ability to pool motion have largely been established using the motion coherence paradigm, in which observers report the direction of coherently moving dots amid randomly moving noise dots. Poor performance by autistic individuals on this task has widely been interpreted as evidence of disrupted integrative processes. Critically, however, motion coherence thresholds are not necessarily limited only by pooling. They could also be limited by imprecision in estimating the direction of individual elements or by difficulties segregating signal from noise. Here, 33 children with autism 6–13 years of age and 33 age- and ability-matched typical children performed a more robust task reporting mean dot direction both in the presence and the absence of directional variability alongside a standard motion coherence task. Children with autism were just as sensitive to directional differences as typical children when all elements moved in the same direction (no variability). However, remarkably, children with autism were more sensitive to the average direction in the presence of directional variability, providing the first evidence of enhanced motion integration in autism. Despite this improved averaging ability, children with autism performed comparably to typical children in the motion coherence task, suggesting that their motion coherence thresholds may be limited by reduced segregation of signal from noise. Although potentially advantageous under some conditions, increased integration may lead to feelings of “sensory overload” in children with autism.},

Here, we discuss three distinct actions of noise in neural networks, arguing in each case that autism spectrum disorder symptoms reflect too little, rather than too much, neural noise. Such reduced noise, perhaps a function of atypical brainstem activation, would enhance detection and discrimination in autism spectrum disorder but at significant cost, foregoing the widespread benefits of noise in neural networks.},

The tasks were administrated to 33 participants with OCD and 30 healthy control participants. In the VR task, participants navigated through a virtual environment using a joystick and head-mounted display. The virtual environment consisted of three phases: training, distraction, and the main task. After the training and distraction phases, participants were allowed to check (a common OCD behavior) freely, as they would in the real world, and a visual analogy scale of anxiety was recorded during VR. Participants' anxiety in the virtual environment was measured with a validated measure of psychiatric symptoms and functions and analyzed with a VR questionnaire. Results revealed that those with OCD had significantly higher anxiety in the virtual environment than did healthy controls, and the decreased ratio of anxiety in participants with OCD was also higher than that of healthy controls. Moreover, the degree of anxiety of an individual with OCD was positively correlated with a his or her symptom score and immersive tendency score. These results suggest the possibility that VR technology has a value as an anxiety-provoking or treatment tool for OCD. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASCs) are characterized by a high degree of clinical heterogeneity, but the extent to which this variation represents a severity gradient versus discrete phenotypes is unclear. This issue has complicated genetic studies seeking to investigate the genetic basis of the high hereditability observed clinically in those with an ASC. The aim of this study was to examine the possible clustering of symptoms associated with ASCs to determine whether the observed distribution of symptom type and severity supported either a severity or a symptom subgroup model to account for the phenotypic variation observed within the ASCs. Methods: We investigated the responses of a group of adults with higher functioning ASCs on the fifty clinical features examined in the Autism Spectrum Quotient, a screening questionnaire used in the diagnosis of higher functioning ASCs. In contrast to previous studies we have used this instrument with no a priori assumptions about any underlying factor structure of constituent items. The responses obtained were analyzed using complete linkage hierarchical cluster analysis. For the members of each cluster identified the mean score on each Autism Spectrum Quotient question was calculated. Results: Autism Spectrum Quotient responses from a total of 333 individuals between the ages of 16.6 and 78.0 years were entered into the hierarchical cluster analysis. The four cluster solution was the one that generated the largest number of clusters that did not also include very small cluster sizes, defined as a membership comprising 10 individuals or fewer. Examination of these clusters demonstrated that they varied in total Autism Spectrum Quotient but that the profiles across the symptoms comprising the Autism Spectrum Quotient did not differ independently of this severity factor. Conclusion: These results are consistent with a unitary spectrum model, suggesting that the clinical heterogeneity observed in those with an autistic spectrum condition at the higher-IQ end of the spectrum is associated with a gradient in the overall severity of the ASC rather than with the presence of different specific symptom profiles in different individuals.

This study aimed to document children's own descriptions of their anxiety symptomatology by combining profiles on a standardized autism-specific self-report measure of anxiety (ASC-ASD-C) with the answers from closed- and open-answer questions about anxiety across home, school, and community settings. Across the sample of 113 children on the spectrum aged 6–14 years, the two most frequently endorsed items on the ASC-ASD-C were from the Uncertainty and Performance Anxiety subscales, and the least endorsed were both from the Anxious Arousal subscale. Almost all (96.5\%) of the children on the spectrum reported experiencing anxiety in at least one setting, with 40.7\% reporting anxiety in all three contexts (home, school, and community). Approximately half of the sample felt their anxiety goes unrecognized by others at school and almost 60\% felt it was unrecognized by others when out in the community. The proportion of children reporting having someone to help reduce their anxiety differed across home (86\%), school (76\%), and community (45\%) settings.

In this commentary we argue that a fine-grained understanding of individual differences in sensory features and their influence across the life span can constrain noted clinical heterogeneity in ASD. We organize our discussion around the following three critical themes: (a) considering sensory features as dimensional construct; (b) taking an “individual differences” approach; and (c) adopting a comprehensive, multidimensional and multimodal approach to measurement of sensory features. We conclude that future research will need to investigate individual differences in sensory features via: (1) multidimensional and cross-disciplinary examination, (2) prospective longitudinal designs, and (3) dimensional and developmental frameworks that emphasize the potential value of early individual variability as indicators of later outcomes, not only in relation to the categorical diagnostic outcome status but also the presence of other clinical features. This is a key time for sensory-related research and in this commentary we provide some of the steps that, in our opinion, can shape future research in this area.

	abstract = {Computational methods are increasingly being applied to the study of psychiatric disorders. Often, this involves fitting models to the behavior of individuals with subclinical character traits that are known vulnerability factors for the development of psychiatric conditions. Anxiety disorders can be examined with reference to the behavior of individuals high in "trait" anxiety, which is a known vulnerability factor for the development of anxiety and mood disorders. However, it is not clear how this self-report measure relates to neural and behavioral processes captured by computational models. This paper reviews emerging computational approaches to the study of trait anxiety, specifying how interacting processes susceptible to analysis using computational models could drive a tendency to experience frequent anxious states and promote vulnerability to the development of clinical disorders. Existing computational studies are described in the light of this perspective and appropriate targets for future studies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Since the documented observations of Kanner in 1943, there has been great debate about the diagnoses, the sub-types, and the diagnostic threshold that relates to what is now known as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Reflecting this complicated history, there has been continual refinement from DSM-III with ‘Infantile Autism’ to the current DSM-V diagnosis. The disorder is now widely accepted as a complex, pervasive, heterogeneous condition with multiple etiologies, sub-types, and developmental trajectories. Diagnosis remains based on observation of atypical behaviors, with criteria of persistent deficits in social communication and restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior. This review provides a broad overview of the history, prevalence, etiology, clinical presentation, and heterogeneity of ASD. Factors contributing to heterogeneity, including genetic variability, comorbidity, and gender are reviewed. We then explore current evidence-based pharmacological and behavioral treatments for ASD and highlight the complexities of conducting clinical trials that evaluate therapeutic efficacy in ASD populations. Finally, we discuss the potential of a new wave of research examining objective biomarkers to facilitate the evaluation of sub-typing, diagnosis, and treatment response in ASD.},

Three subgroups comprising 45-62\% of ASC adults show evidence for large impairments (Cohen's d = -1.03 to -11.21), while other subgroups are effectively unimpaired.

To address this concern, we sought to identify more homogeneous subgroups within ASD based on toddlers' clinical profiles in the second year of life, evaluating diagnostic stability and clinical outcomes within the subgroups 1-2 years later. Methods One hundred toddlers referred for suspected ASD underwent comprehensive assessments at 22 months (SD = 3) and 37 months (SD = 4). At 22 months, they were clustered based on symptom severity, developmental skills, and adaptive functioning. Diagnostic stability and clinical outcomes were evaluated within the clusters. Results Four clusters characterized by distinct clinical profiles at the time of the first diagnosis were identified. Diagnostic stability was excellent in 3 out of 4 clusters (93\%-100\%) and was lowest in the initially least affected cluster (85\%). Autism symptom severity was stable, except for one group where it increased over time (16\% of the sample). A large proportion of toddlers showed significant improvements in verbal and communication skills. Only a small group (17\%) exhibited very low levels of functioning and limited gains over time. Conclusions Diagnostic stability and developmental progression from the second to third year of life in toddlers with ASD vary depending on their initial early profiles of relative strengths and deficits. Although a small minority of toddlers with more complex clinical presentations may not retain their diagnoses by the age of three, most children continue to exhibit symptoms of autism. Despite limited improvements in symptom severity, many children show significant gains in verbal functioning. Only a small proportion of children (17\%) exhibit very limited gains despite intensive intervention. These findings support continued efforts to examine determinants of developmental trajectories including factors mediating and moderating response to treatment.},

Consequently, it is not surprising that test anxiety is a pervasive problem for many students who are so disturbed by the stress associated with taking tests that they experience substantial decrements in performance in evaluative situations. During examinations, individuals high in test anxiety are more likely to experience frequent and intense elevations in anxiety as an emotional state (S-Anxiety), greater activation of the autonomic nervous system, and more self-centered worry and task-irrelevant thoughts that interfere with attention and performance. Given these characteristics, test anxiety can be viewed as a situation-specific personality trait (Spielberger, Gonzalez, Taylor, Algaze, \& Anton, 1978).},

However, a very limited number of studies exist in the literature to determine the influence of these technologies on user Quality of Experience (QoE). In order to evaluate QoE as users consume VR content, this paper proposes the use of affordable consumer electronics to capture objective physiological metrics: Heart Rate (HR) and ElectroDermal Activity (EDA). Our findings indicate different HR and EDA dependent on VR and non-VR environments. Additionally, we examine the relationship between these objective metrics and user QoE captured via a post-test questionnaire.

ASD has a high prevalence in children, affecting 1 in 160 subjects. Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an effective tool for intervention in the health field. Different recent papers have reviewed the VR-based treatments in ASD, but they have an important limitation because they only use clinical databases and do not include important technical indexes such as the Web of Science index or the Scimago Journal \& Country Rank. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution that has carried out an evidence-based systematic review including both clinical and technical databases about the effectiveness of VR-based intervention in ASD. The initial search identified a total of 450 records. After the exclusion of the papers that are not studies, duplicated articles, and the screening of the abstract and full text, 31 articles met the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes) criteria and were selected for analysis. The studies examined suggest moderate evidence about the effectiveness of VR-based treatments in ASD. VR can add many advantages to the treatment of ASD symptomatology, but it is necessary to develop consistent validations in future studies to state that VR can effectively complement the traditional treatments.},

	abstract = {We introduce the network model as a formal psychometric model, conceptualizing the covariance between psychometric indicators as resulting from pairwise interactions between observable variables in a network structure. This contrasts with standard psychometric models, in which the covariance between test items arises from the influence of one or more common latent variables. Here, we present two generalizations of the network model that encompass latent variable structures, establishing network modeling as parts of the more general framework of structural equation modeling (SEM). In the first generalization, we model the covariance structure of latent variables as a network. We term this framework latent network modeling (LNM) and show that, with LNM, a unique structure of conditional independence relationships between latent variables can be obtained in an explorative manner. In the second generalization, the residual variance–covariance structure of indicators is modeled as a network. We term this generalization residual network modeling (RNM) and show that, within this framework, identifiable models can be obtained in which local independence is structurally violated. These generalizations allow for a general modeling framework that can be used to fit, and compare, SEM models, network models, and the RNM and LNM generalizations. This methodology has been implemented in the free-to-use software package lvnet, which contains confirmatory model testing as well as two exploratory search algorithms: stepwise search algorithms for low-dimensional datasets and penalized maximum likelihood estimation for larger datasets. We show in simulation studies that these search algorithms perform adequately in identifying the structure of the relevant residual or latent networks. We further demonstrate the utility of these generalizations in an empirical example on a personality inventory dataset.},

This is addressed in two complimentary studies: (1) Study 1 focusing on depressed (N = 258) and non-depressed adults (N = 117), aged 60–90 years; (2) Study 2 focusing on autistic (N = 173) and non-autistic adults (N = 70), aged 31–89 years. Self-report questionnaire data were collected on autistic traits (AQ-28), depression symptoms (Study 1: Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self Report; Study 2: Symptom Checklist 90–Revised depression subscale), worry (Worry Scale-R) and mastery (the Pearlin Mastery Scale). For both studies, data were analysed by creating glasso networks and subsequent centrality analyses to identify the most influential variables in the respective networks. Both depressed and autistic adults are highly similar in the perceived amount of worries and lack of control. While caution is needed when interpreting the pattern of findings given the bootstrapping results, findings from both studies indicate that overlapping symptoms do not fully explain the co-occurrence of autism and depression and the perception of having control over your life, that is, mastery seems a relevant factor in connecting autism and depression.},

Alternative language attesting conformity with the Helsinki Declaration is often included when the research was conducted in Europe or elsewhere. The Helsinki Declaration was created by the World Medical Association in 1964 (ten years before the Belmont Report) and has been amended several times. The Helsinki Declaration differs from its American version in several respects, the most significant of which is that it was developed by and for physicians. The term "patient" appears in many places where we would expect to see "subject." It is stated in several places that physicians must either conduct or have supervisory control of the research. The dual role of the physician-researcher is acknowledged, but it is made clear that the role of healer takes precedence over that of scientist. In the United States, the federal government developed and enforces regulations on researcher; in the rest of the world, the profession, or a significant part of it, took the initiative in defining and promoting good research practice, and governments in many countries have worked to harmonize their standards along these lines. The Helsinki Declaration is based less on key philosophical principles and more on prescriptive statements. Although there is significant overlap between the Belmont and the Helsinki guidelines, the latter extends much further into research design and publication. Elements in a research protocol, use of placebos, and obligation to enroll trials in public registries (to ensure that negative findings are not buried), and requirements to share findings with the research and professional communities are included in the Helsinki Declaration. As a practical matter, these are often part of the work of American IRBs, but not always as a formal requirement. Reflecting the socialist nature of many European counties, there is a requirement that provision be made for patients to be made whole regardless of the outcomes of the trial or if they happened to have been randomized to a control group that did not enjoy the benefits of a successful experimental intervention.},

	abstract = {Background Phenotypic heterogeneity in autism has long been conjectured to be a major hindrance to the discovery of genetic risk factors, leading to numerous attempts to stratify children based on phenotype to increase power of discovery studies. This approach, however, is based on the hypothesis that phenotypic heterogeneity closely maps to genetic variation, which has not been tested. Our study examines the impact of subphenotyping of a well-characterized autism spectrum disorder (ASD) sample on genetic homogeneity and the ability to discover common genetic variants conferring liability to ASD. Methods Genome-wide genotypic data of 2576 families from the Simons Simplex Collection were analyzed in the overall sample and phenotypic subgroups defined on the basis of diagnosis, IQ, and symptom profiles. We conducted a family-based association study, as well as estimating heritability and evaluating allele scores for each phenotypic subgroup. Results Association analyses revealed no genome-wide significant association signal. Subphenotyping did not increase power substantially. Moreover, allele scores built from the most associated single nucleotide polymorphisms, based on the odds ratio in the full sample, predicted case status in subsets of the sample equally well and heritability estimates were very similar for all subgroups. Conclusions In genome-wide association analysis of the Simons Simplex Collection sample, reducing phenotypic heterogeneity had at most a modest impact on genetic homogeneity. Our results are based on a relatively small sample, one with greater homogeneity than the entire population; if they apply more broadly, they imply that analysis of subphenotypes is not a productive path forward for discovering genetic risk variants in ASD.},

In this Review, we discuss how some of the latest advances in the genetics of ASD have facilitated parsing of the phenotypic heterogeneity of this disorder. We argue that only through such advances will we begin to define endophenotypes that can benefit from targeted, hypothesis-driven treatments. We review the latest technologies used to identify and characterize the genetics underlying ASD and then consider three themes-single-gene disorders, the gender bias in ASD, and the genetics of neurological comorbidities-that highlight ways in which we can use genetics to define the many phenotypes within the autism spectrum.

There has been a strong presumption that these different features of the syndrome are strongly intertwined and proceed from a common cause at the genetic, cognitive and neural levels. In this review we examine evidence for an alternative approach, considering the triad as largely 'fractionable'. We present evidence from our own twin studies, and review relevant literature on autism and autistic-like traits in other groups. We suggest that largely independent genes may operate on social skills/impairments, communication abilities, and RRBIs, requiring a change in molecular-genetic research approaches. At the cognitive level, we suggest that satisfactory accounts exist for each of the triad domains, but no single unitary account can explain both social and nonsocial features of autism. We discuss the implications of the fractionable-triad approach for both diagnosis and future research directions. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Objective: To explore genetic and environmental influences on individual differences in autistic traits in early adulthood and to test if there is assortative mating (non-random partner choice) for autistic traits in the general population. Design: Twin family study using structural equation modeling. Setting: Population-based twin family sample from the Netherlands. Participants: Twins aged 18 years (n=370) and their siblings (n=94); parents of twins (128 couples). Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores, a quantitative measure of autistic traits. Results: Autistic traits were continuously distributed in the population. Twins and siblings did not significantly differ in AQ scores; men obtained significantly higher AQ scores than women (in twin-sibling sample, P{\textless}.001; twin-parent sample, P=.02). Individual differences in endorsement on autistic traits show substantial heritability (57\%). No significant shared environmental influences were detected. The genes affecting autistic traits appear to be the same across the sexes. The correlation in AQ score between spouses was low and not significant (Pearson r=.05; P=.59). Conclusions: Previous general population twin studies reported high heritability for autistic traits in childhood and early adolescence. This study extends these findings to late adolescence and yields no evidence for sex-specific genetic influences on autistic traits in later stages of development. As autistic traits show substantial variation in the general population, future genetic studies may be facilitated by measuring autistic traits on a continuous scale like the AQ. No evidence for assortative mating for autistic traits was found, suggesting that, in the general population, there is no passive or active partner selection for autistic traits. © 2007 American Medical Association.

A taxometric analysis of Adult Autism Spectrum Quotient data was conducted to test this assumption, finding little support but identifying a high severity taxon. To understand this further, latent class and latent profile models were estimated that indicated the presence of six distinct subtypes: one with little probability of endorsing any autistic traits, one engaging in ‘systemising’ behaviours, three groups endorsing multiple components of Wing and Gould’s autistic triad, and a group similar in size and profile to the taxon previously identified. These analyses suggest the AQ (and potentially by extension autistic traits) have a categorical structure. These findings have important implications for the analysis and interpretation of AQ data.},

If the sources of heterogeneity are observed (e.g., gender), the sample can be split into groups and the data analyzed with methods for multiple groups. If the sources of population heterogeneity are unobserved, the data can be analyzed with latent class models. Factor mixture models are a combination of latent class and common factor models and can be used to explore unobserved population heterogeneity. Observed sources of heterogeneity can be included as covariates. The different ways to incorporate covariates correspond to different conceptual interpretations. These are discussed in detail. Characteristics of factor mixture modeling are described in comparison to other methods designed for data stemming from heterogeneous populations. A step-by-step analysis of a subset of data from the Longitudinal Survey of American Youth illustrates how factor mixture models can be applied in an exploratory fashion to data collected at a single time point.

	abstract = {Autism is a diagnostic label based on behavior. While the diagnostic criteria attempt to maximize clinical consensus, it also masks a wide degree of heterogeneity between and within individuals at multiple levels of analysis. Understanding this multi-level heterogeneity is of high clinical and translational importance. Here we present organizing principles to frame research examining multi-level heterogeneity in autism. Theoretical concepts such as ‘spectrum’ or ‘autisms’ reflect non-mutually exclusive explanations regarding continuous/dimensional or categorical/qualitative variation between and within individuals. However, common practices of small sample size studies and case–control models are suboptimal for tackling heterogeneity. Big data are an important ingredient for furthering our understanding of heterogeneity in autism. In addition to being ‘feature-rich’, big data should be both ‘broad’ (i.e., large sample size) and ‘deep’ (i.e., multiple levels of data collected on the same individuals). These characteristics increase the likelihood that the study results are more generalizable and facilitate evaluation of the utility of different models of heterogeneity. A model’s utility can be measured by its ability to explain clinically or mechanistically important phenomena, and also by explaining how variability manifests across different levels of analysis. The directionality for explaining variability across levels can be bottom-up or top-down, and should include the importance of development for characterizing changes within individuals. While progress can be made with ‘supervised’ models built upon a priori or theoretically predicted distinctions or dimensions of importance, it will become increasingly important to complement such work with unsupervised data-driven discoveries that leverage unknown and multivariate distinctions within big data. A better understanding of how to model heterogeneity between autistic people will facilitate progress towards precision medicine for symptoms that cause suffering, and person-centered support.},

The Ising model is a model used in ferromagnetism to explain phase transitions in a field of particles. Following the description of the Ising model in statistical physics, the chapter continues to show that the Ising model is closely related to models used in psychometrics. The Ising model can be shown to be equivalent to certain kinds of logistic regression models, loglinear models and multi-dimensional item response theory (MIRT) models. The equivalence between the Ising model and the MIRT model puts standard psychometrics in a new light and leads to a strikingly different interpretation of well-known latent variable models. The chapter gives an overview of methods that can be used to estimate the Ising model, and concludes with a discussion on the interpretation of latent variables given the equivalence between the Ising model and MIRT.},

	abstract = {The usage of psychological networks that conceptualize psychological behavior as a complex interplay of psychological and other components has gained increasing popularity in various fields of psychology. While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

Although literature points out that anxiety symptoms are related to problems in social and academic functioning, the extent of these problems among adolescents with clinical anxiety disorders has not been systematically reviewed before. Methods: Electronic databases were searched up to October 2017, with keywords representing anxiety disorders, adolescents, and social or academic functioning. The inclusion criteria were studies with a sample of adolescents (10–19 years) with anxiety disorders that provided data regarding their social or academic functioning. 3431 studies were examined, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria. Results: Adolescents with anxiety disorders had a lower social competence relative to their healthy peers. They reported more negativity within interpersonal relationships, higher levels of loneliness, and victimization. Most adolescents with anxiety disorders felt impaired at school, however, findings of their average school results, compared to peers, were mixed. In addition, they had a higher risk for school refusal and entered higher education less often. Impairments in social and academic functioning differed across type and the number of anxiety disorders. Limitations: Most studies examined social phobia or anxiety disorders in general and methodological approaches varied widely between studies. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that adolescents with anxiety disorders experience a range of significant problems in both social and academic functioning. These findings suggest that the assessment and treatment of anxiety disorders in adolescence should focus on improving functioning across domains.},

The advantages of longitudinal design were utilized, including testing of reversed causation and controlling for unmeasured third variables. In general, the results showed that the hypothesized normal causal relationship was superior to a reversed causation model. In other words, this study supported the assumption that work engagement is more likely to be the antecedent for symptoms of depression and anxiety than the outcome. In particular, the vigour facet of work engagement provides lower levels of depression and anxiety 2 years later. However, additional analyses modelling unmeasured third variables indicate that unknown third variables may have created some spurious effects on the pattern of the observed relationship.

METHOD Using data from the National Comorbidity Study, we applied multivariate regression techniques to calculate the costs associated with anxiety disorders, after adjusting for demographic characteristics and the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions. Based on additional data, in part from a large managed care organization, we estimated a human capital model of the societal cost of anxiety disorders. RESULTS We estimated the annual cost of anxiety disorders to be approximately \$42.3 billion in 1990 in the United States, or \$1542 per sufferer. This comprises \$23.0 billion (or 54\% of the total cost) in nonpsychiatric medical treatment costs, S13.3 billion (31\%) in psychiatric treatment costs, \$4.1 billion (10\%) in indirect workplace costs, \$1.2 billion (3\%) in mortality costs, and \$0.8 billion (2\%) in prescription pharmaceutical costs. Of the \$256 in workplace costs per anxious worker, 88\% is attributable to lost productivity while at work as opposed to absenteeism. Posttraumatic stress disorder and panic disorder are the anxiety disorders found to have the highest rates of service use. Other than simple phobia, all anxiety disorders analyzed are associated with impairment in workplace performance. CONCLUSION Anxiety disorders impose a substantial cost on society, much of which may be avoidable with more widespread awareness, recognition, and appropriate early intervention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND A fragmented research field exists on the prevalence of anxiety disorders. Here, we present the results of a systematic review of reviews on this topic. We included the highest quality studies to inform practice and policy on this issue. METHOD Using PRISMA methodology, extensive electronic and manual citation searches were performed to identify relevant reviews. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were undertaken by two reviewers. Inclusion criteria consisted of systematic reviews or meta-analyses on the prevalence of anxiety disorders that fulfilled at least half of the AMSTAR quality criteria. RESULTS We identified a total of 48 reviews and described the prevalence of anxiety across population subgroups and settings, as reported by these studies. Despite the high heterogeneity of prevalence estimates across primary studies, there was emerging and compelling evidence of substantial prevalence of anxiety disorders generally (3.8-25\%), and particularly in women (5.2-8.7\%); young adults (2.5-9.1\%); people with chronic diseases (1.4-70\%); and individuals from Euro/Anglo cultures (3.8-10.4\%) versus individuals from Indo/Asian (2.8\%), African (4.4\%), Central/Eastern European (3.2\%), North African/Middle Eastern (4.9\%), and Ibero/Latin cultures (6.2\%). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anxiety disorders is high in population subgroups across the globe. Recent research has expanded its focus to Asian countries, an increasingly greater number of physical and psychiatric conditions, and traumatic events associated with anxiety. Further research on illness trajectories and anxiety levels pre- and post-treatment is needed.

However, recent research has identified intolerance of uncertainty (IU) as a possible transdiagnostic maintaining factor across the anxiety disorders and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether IU mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms related to various anxiety disorders and depression in a treatment-seeking sample (N=328). Consistent with previous research, IU was significantly associated with neuroticism as well as with symptoms of social phobia, panic disorder and agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. Moreover, IU explained unique variance in these symptom measures when controlling for neuroticism. Mediational analyses showed that IU was a significant partial mediator between neuroticism and all symptom measures, even when controlling for symptoms of other disorders. More specifically, anxiety in anticipation of future uncertainty (prospective anxiety) partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (i.e. worry) and obsessive-compulsive disorder, whereas inaction in the face of uncertainty (inhibitory anxiety) partially mediated the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of social anxiety, panic disorder and agoraphobia, and depression. Sobel's test demonstrated that all hypothesized meditational pathways were associated with significant indirect effects, although the mediation effect was stronger for worry than other symptoms. Potential implications of these findings for the treatment of anxiety disorders and depression are discussed. © 2011 Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.},

The present study examined the relationships among measures of worry, intolerance of uncertainty, intolerance of ambiguity, perfectionism, and perceived control in a sample of 197 university students. The findings indicated that intolerance of uncertainty moderately overlaps with earlier conceptualizations of intolerance of ambiguity; however, worry was more highly related to intolerance of uncertainty than to intolerance of ambiguity. Intolerance of uncertainty also emerged as the most salient predictor of worry compared to other cognitive processes such as perfectionism and perceived control. Worry and intolerance of uncertainty continued to be significantly related after controlling for intolerance of ambiguity, perfectionism, and perceived control, which implies that intolerance of uncertainty shares a unique association with worry that is not accounted for by these other cognitive factors.

	abstract = {Background Anxiety symptoms are common in autistic children; however, it is difficult to accurately assess the symptoms of anxiety in this population due to a lack of autism‐specific anxiety assessment tools. The Anxiety Scale for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASC‐ASD) is a newly developed measure designed to address this need. The ASC‐ASD is designed specifically for use with autistic children, and is designed to assess both typical and atypical anxiety symptomatology. This study aimed to provide preliminary data regarding the validity of the ASC‐ASD, as well as rates of cross‐informant agreement and prevalence of anxiety symptomatology as measured by the ASC‐ASD. Methods In order to explore the profile of anxiety symptomatology captured by the ASC‐ASD, the ASC‐ASD and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) were administered to 30 autistic children, ages 10–12, and their parents. Results High rates of anxiety symptomatology were found, with 46\% of the children and 80\% of their parents reporting scores in the clinical range on the SCAS. Scores on the SCAS and ASC‐ASD were moderately to strongly correlated. Overall, children tended to endorse more items on the ASC‐ASD, whereas parents tended to endorse more items on the SCAS. Conclusions Findings suggest that autistic children and their parents may have different perceptions of the anxiety symptoms experienced by autistic children. Findings also indicated that the ASC‐ASD has promise as an autism‐specific assessment of anxiety symptomatology in children, although further research is required in this area.

The present study recruited 580 NT adults and 42 high-functioning ASD adults with a confirmed diagnosis to investigate the relationship between specific aspects of autistic traits and sensory processing using the subscales of the autism spectrum quotient (AQ) and adult/adolescent sensory profile (AASP). Results showed a significant relationship between all subscales except for attention to detail and imagination on the AQ and provided the first evidence that the strength and pattern of this relationship is identical between NT and ASD adults. These data also provided support for the broader autism phenotype, uncovering a clear progression of sensory atypicalities in line with an increase in autistic traits, regardless of diagnostic status, which has potential implications for the spectrum approach to ASD and how sensory behaviours across the whole of the neurotypical population are conceptualised.},

However, limited measures that assess these problems in adults with ASD have been developed till date, particularly in Japan. Robertson and Simmons (2012) developed a self-rating scale to investigate sensory sensitivity: the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ). In the present study, we developed a Japanese version of GSQ and investigated sensory abnormalities in adults with ASD. We compared results of the Japanese version of GSQ in adults between an ASD group (n = 64) and a control group (n = 70). In addition, we also administered these individuals with the autism spectrum quotient (AQ), which is a questionnaire for assessing autistic traits. The Japanese version of GSQ scores was significantly higher in the ASD group than that in the control group. The total GSQ score and each sensory subscale showed a positive correlation with AQ in the total study sample. These results indicate that individuals with pronounced autistic traits have more frequent and extreme sensory processing problems compared with that in individuals with less pronounced autistic traits. We also assessed validity of the new test. Cronbach's α of the questionnaire was calculated, and its high value indicates that the Japanese version of GSQ has high reliability. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Auditory integration therapy was developed as a technique for improving abnormal sound sensitivity in individuals with behavioural disorders including autism spectrum disorders. Other sound therapies bearing similarities to auditory integration therapy include the Tomatis Method and Samonas Sound Therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness of auditory integration therapy or other methods of sound therapy in individuals with autism spectrum disorders. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched the following databases in September 2010: CENTRAL (2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1950 to September week 2, 2010), EMBASE (1980 to Week 38, 2010), CINAHL (1937 to current), PsycINFO (1887 to current), ERIC (1966 to current), LILACS (September 2010) and the reference lists of published papers. One new study was found for inclusion. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials involving adults or children with autism spectrum disorders. Treatment was auditory integration therapy or other sound therapies involving listening to music modified by filtering and modulation. Control groups could involve no treatment, a waiting list, usual therapy or a placebo equivalent. The outcomes were changes in core and associated features of autism spectrum disorders, auditory processing, quality of life and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent review authors performed data extraction. All outcome data in the included papers were continuous. We calculated point estimates and standard errors from t-test scores and post-intervention means. Meta-analysis was inappropriate for the available data. MAIN RESULTS: We identified six randomised comtrolled trials of auditory integration therapy and one of Tomatis therapy, involving a total of 182 individuals aged three to 39 years. Two were cross-over trials. Five trials had fewer than 20 participants. Allocation concealment was inadequate for all studies. Twenty different outcome measures were used and only two outcomes were used by three or more studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to very high heterogeneity or the presentation of data in unusable forms. Three studies (Bettison 1996; Zollweg 1997; Mudford 2000) did not demonstrate any benefit of auditory integration therapy over control conditions. Three studies (Veale 1993; Rimland 1995; Edelson 1999) reported improvements at three months for the auditory integration therapy group based on the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist, but they used a total score rather than subgroup scores, which is of questionable validity, and Veale's results did not reach statistical significance. Rimland 1995 also reported improvements at three months in the auditory integration therapy group for the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist subgroup scores. The study addressing Tomatis therapy (Corbett 2008) described an improvement in language with no difference between treatment and control conditions and did not report on the behavioural outcomes that were used in the auditory integration therapy trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that auditory integration therapy or other sound therapies are effective as treatments for autism spectrum disorders. As synthesis of existing data has been limited by the disparate outcome measures used between studies, there is not sufficient evidence to prove that this treatment is not effective. However, of the seven studies including 182 participants that have been reported to date, only two (with an author in common), involving a total of 35 participants, report statistically significant improvements in the auditory intergration therapy group and for only two outcome measures (Aberrant Behaviour Checklist and Fisher's Auditory Problems Checklist). As such, there is no evidence to support the use of auditory integration therapy at this time.},

Roughly half of patients with panic disorder will experience nocturnal panic in addition to panic attacks while awake, or daytime panic. Like daytime panic, nocturnal panic also occurs in other disorders such as PTSD. The Fear of Loss of Vigilance theory is currently the only model available to explain nocturnal panic. It suggests nocturnal panickers fear states in which they cannot easily react to or protect themselves from danger. The current study sought to expand upon the existing theory by including constructs from the broader anxiety literature. Nocturnal panickers were expected to report higher scores on these measures when compared to daytime panickers and non-panickers. Participants: A sample of 166 participants were screened for panic history. Methods: Participants completed self-report measures regarding panic attacks, fear of sleep, intolerance of uncertainty, responsibility for harm, and fear of loss of vigilance. Results: Measures of fear of sleep and responsibility for harm successfully differentiated nocturnal from daytime panickers, whereas measures of intolerance of uncertainty and fear of loss of vigilance did not. Conclusions: These results provide partial support for the Fear of Loss of Vigilance theory. Modifications to the theory to incorporate additional constructs are suggested.},

The highly related concept—intolerance of uncertainty (IU)—emerged in the early 1990s, which is further developed into a transdiagnostic risk factor in multiple forms of anxiety disorders. Interests in uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty have rapidly increased in recent years; little is known about the construct and phenomenology of uncertainty and IU and the association between them. In an attempt to reveal the nature of two concepts, we reviewed broad literature surrounding uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty (IU). We followed the process in which the whole IU theory developed and extended, including two aspects: (1) from uncertainty to intolerance of uncertainty and (2) definition of uncertainty and intolerance of uncertainty, and further concluded uncertainty fuels to negative emotions, biased expectancy, and inflexible response. Secondly, this paper summarized the experimental research concerning uncertainty and IU, consisted of three parts: (1) uncertainty-based research, (2) measurements of IU, and (3) domain-specific IU. Lastly, we pointed out what remains unknown and needed to be investigated in future research. This result provides a comprehensive overview in this domain, enhancing our understanding of uncertainty and IU and contributing to further theoretical and empirical explorations.},

	abstract = {Abstract: According to the predictive coding framework, percepts emerge from combinations of sensory input and prior knowledge, whose relative contributions depend on their reliability. Recent predictive coding theories suggest that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) could be characterized by an atypical weighting of priors. Here, we assessed whether individuals with ASD can flexibly adjust the weight (precision) of the prior to the context. Thirty-one neurotypical adults (NT) and 26 adults with ASD participated in a visual discrimination task designed to elicit a time-order effect (TOE). The TOE reflects the integration of priors with sensory estimates. We used two experimental contexts: a narrow stimulus range (Narrow condition) and a broader range (Broad condition) in order to induce a prior with a higher and lower precision, respectively. Both groups learned a prior that biased their perception, as shown with the TOE. As expected, the NT group had a larger TOE in the Narrow condition than in the Broad condition, revealing a contextual adjustment of the prior precision. In contrast, ASD participants were more inflexible: the extent of the TOE was not modulated by the context. In addition, the accuracy increased when the stimulus range decreased in both group, which may be interpreted as a contextual adjustment of the sensory precision. To conclude, adults with and without ASD implicitly learned a prior mean, but ASD participants failed to flexibly adjust the prior precision to the context. This increased inflexibility in ASD could account for many symptoms, such as their intolerance of uncertainty. Lay Summary: Based on our experience, we have expectations about our environment. Theories suggest that the symptoms encountered in autism could be due to atypical expectations, leading to an impression of an unpredictable world. Using a visual discrimination task, we showed that adults with and without autism were biased by their expectations. Yet, the extent to which expectations biased perception did not depend on the context in autism. This higher inflexibility found in autism may explain symptoms such as resistance to change.},

Differential relationships between traditional anxiety, atypical anxiety, child characteristics, anxiety predictors and ASD-symptomology were explored. Fifty-nine participants (7–17 years, Mage = 10.48 years; IQ {\textgreater} 60) with ASD and parents completed semi-structured interviews, self- and parent-reports. Seventeen percent of youth presented with traditional anxiety, 15 \% with atypical anxiety, and 31 \% with both. Language ability, anxious cognitions and hypersensitivity predicted traditional anxiety, whereas traditional anxiety and ASD symptoms predicted atypical anxiety. Findings suggest youth with ASD express anxiety in ways similar and dissimilar to DSM definitions. Similarities support the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders in ASD. Whether dissimilarities are unique to ASD requires further examination.},

Importantly, observations of behavioral hypo- and hyperresponsivity to pain suggest altered pain sensitivity in autism spectrum disorder. Neuroimaging may provide insight into mechanisms underlying pain behaviors. The neural pain signature reliably responds to painful stimulation and is modulated by other outside regions, affecting the pain experience. In this first functional magnetic resonance imaging study of pain in autism spectrum disorder, we investigated neural responses to pain in 15 adults with autism spectrum disorder relative to a typical comparison group (n = 16). We explored temporal and spatial properties of the neural pain signature and its modulators during sustained heat pain. The two groups had indistinguishable pain ratings and neural pain signature responses during acute pain; yet, we observed strikingly reduced neural pain signature response in autism spectrum disorder during sustained pain and after stimulus offset. The posterior cingulate cortex, a neural pain signature modulating region, mirrored this late signal reduction in autism spectrum disorder. Intact early responses, followed by diminished late responses to sustained pain, may reflect altered pain coping or evaluation in autism spectrum disorder. Evidence of a dichotomous neural response to initial versus protracted pain may clarify the coexistence of both hypo- and hyperresponsiveness to pain in autism spectrum disorder.},

	abstract = {Background/aim: Unusual responses to sensations can impact upon the daily activities for individuals with autism spectrum disorder. Current understandings of these sensory experiences have been drawn from the proxy reports from parents/caregivers, standardised self-report questionnaires and autobiographical accounts. As sensory experiences are intensely personal, the first-hand accounts of people with autism spectrum disorder may have greater validity than caregiver reports, but these have never been systematically researched. This study explored the utility of using a semi-structured interview protocol augmented with visual cues to facilitate our understanding of the way people with autism spectrum disorder experience sensory input, and use coping strategies to manage sensory issues that interfere with participation. Method: A semi-structured interview augmented by visual cues was used to investigate the sensory experiences of three adolescent males with autism spectrum disorder. As is common in this population, two of the participants also had a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and were taking stimulant medication. Results: Participants shared a preference for expected, predictable and controllable sensory input, whereas unexpected, unpredictable and uncontrollable sensations were perceived as unpleasant. A heightened awareness of and difficulty filtering extraneous sensory input, high levels of movement seeking and an over-focus on salient sensory input were also described. Strategies employed to manage sensory challenges included avoiding, increasing predictability and control and meta-cognitive adaptations. Conclusions: Further research involving a larger sample of participants is recommended to determine the utility of using a semi-structured interview protocol augmented with visual cues to understand the sensory experiences of individuals with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder. © 2013 Occupational Therapy Australia.},

Some evidences suggest that loss of olfactory function is an early biomarker for neurodegenerative disorders and atypical processing of odor and taste stimuli is present in several neurodevelopmental disorders, notably in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In this paper, we conducted a systematic review investigating the assessments of olfaction and gustation with psychophysics methods in individuals with ASD. Pubmed, PMC and Sciencedirect were scrutinized for relevant literature published from 1970 to 2015. In this review, fourteen papers met our inclusion criteria. They were analyzed critically in order to evaluate the occurrence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in ASD, as well as to report the methods used to assess olfaction and gustation in such conditions. Regarding to these two senses, the overall number of studies is low. Most of studies show significant difference regarding to odor or taste identification but not for detection threshold. Overall, odor rating through pleasantness, intensity and familiarity do not differ significantly between control and individuals with ASD. The current evidences can suggest the presence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction in ASD. Therefore, our analysis show a heterogeneity of findings. This is due to several methodological limitations such as the tools used or population studied. Understanding these disorders could help to shed light on other atypical behavior in this population such as feeding or social behavior.

Results demonstrated that sensory abnormalities were prevalent in ASD, with 94.4 percent of the ASD sample reporting extreme levels of sensory processing on at least one sensory quadrant of the AASP. Furthermore, analysis of the patterns of sensory processing impairments revealed striking within-group variability in the ASD group, suggesting that individuals with ASD could experience very different, yet similarly severe, sensory processing abnormalities.

We also examined the overlap between the AQ and GSQ using a joint factor analysis. The results revealed that the Japanese version of the GSQ has relatively poor psychometric properties compared to the AQ. Gender differences were found in both scales. Individuals with high AQ scores reported experiencing abnormal sensory events more frequently than those with low AQ scores. The overlap between the scales was small; therefore, it might be possible to investigate abnormal sensory processing independently of other symptoms of ASD in the general population.},

	abstract = {Anxiety and sensory symptoms are highly prevalent and meaningful in the daily lives of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the importance of carefully measuring, researching, and treating these symptoms, current methods in ASD seldom include self-report. This study investigated the consistency of adolescent and parent reports of anxiety and auditory sensitivity in individuals with ASD, and examined their validity via comparisons with sympathetic arousal at baseline and in response to an auditory challenge. Fifty adolescent-parent dyads (n = 26 ASD, n = 24 typically developing; 12–16 years old; IQ{\textgreater}80) completed parallel versions of both anxiety and auditory hypersensitivity scales, which were compared to heart rate collected at rest and during an aversive noise task. Adolescents with ASD exhibited greater anxiety and auditory hypersensitivity than their peers, based on both self and parent report. Across groups, self-report was higher than parent report. In individuals with ASD, a significant relationship was found between self-reported anxiety and autonomic arousal at rest, and between self-reported auditory sensitivity and autonomic reactivity during the noise task. These relationships were not significant for parent-report. These findings extend past work by demonstrating greater self-reported (than parent-reported) anxiety and sensory symptoms. Furthermore, the presence of significant correlations between self-reported symptoms and sympathetic arousal supports the validity of self-report in adolescents with ASD with average or above average cognitive abilities. This indicates that adolescents with ASD have a unique perspective on their internal experience, which can complement parent reports and provide a more comprehensive assessment of symptoms in research and clinical settings.},

Easy access to measuring HRV has led to a plethora of studies within emotion science and psychology assessing autonomic regulation, but significant caveats exist due to the complicated nature of HRV. Firstly, both breathing and blood pressure regulation have their own relationship to social, emotional, and cognitive experiments - if this is the case are we observing heart rate (HR) changes as a consequence of breathing changes? Secondly, experiments often have poor internal and external controls. In this review we highlight the interrelationships between HR and respiration, as well as presenting recommendations for researchers to use when collecting data for HRV assessment. Namely, we highlight the superior utility of within-subjects designs along with the importance of establishing an appropriate baseline and monitoring respiration. © 2014 Quintana and Heathers.},

	abstract = {Assessment of anxiety symptoms in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is a challenging task due to the symptom overlap between the two conditions as well as the difficulties in communication and awareness of emotions in ASD. This motivates the development of a physiological marker of anxiety in ASD that is independent of language and does not require observation of overt behaviour. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using indicators of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity for this purpose. Specially, the objectives of the study were to 1) examine whether or not anxiety causes significant measurable changes in indicators of ANS in an ASD population, and 2) characterize the pattern of these changes in ASD. We measured three physiological indicators of the autonomic nervous system response (heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature) during a baseline (movie watching) and anxiety condition (Stroop task) in a sample of typically developing children (n = 17) and children with ASD (n = 12). The anxiety condition caused significant changes in heart rate and electrodermal activity in both groups, however, a differential pattern of response was found between the two groups. In particular, the ASD group showed elevated heart rate during both baseline and anxiety conditions. Elevated and blunted phasic electrodermal activity were found in the ASD group during baseline and anxiety conditions, respectively. Finally, the ASD group did not show the typical decrease in skin temperature in response to anxiety. These results suggest that 1) signals of the autonomic nervous system may be used as indicators of anxiety in children with ASD, and 2) ASD may be associated with an atypical autonomic response to anxiety that is most consistent with sympathetic over-arousal and parasympathetic under-arousal. © 2013 Kushki et al.},

Despite societal interest in SPS, scientific knowledge is lagging behind. Here, we critically discuss how SPS relates to other theories, how to measure SPS, whether SPS is a continuous vs categorical trait, its relation to other temperament and personality traits, the underlying aetiology and neurobiological mechanisms, and relations to both typical and atypical development, including mental and sensory disorders. Drawing on the diverse expertise of the authors, we set an agenda for future research to stimulate the field. We conclude that SPS increases risk for stress-related problems in response to negative environments, but also provides greater benefit from positive and supportive experiences. The field requires more reliable and objective assessment of SPS, and deeper understanding of its mechanisms to differentiate it from other traits. Future research needs to target prevention of adverse effects associated with SPS, and exploitation of its positive potential to improve well-being and mental health.},

We then conducted genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of six trait scores derived from the questionnaire through exploratory factor analysis in 1981 adults from the general population. Using the results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium GWAS of ASDs, we observed genetic sharing between ASDs and the autistic traits 'childhood behavior', 'rigidity' and 'attention to detail'. Gene-set analysis subsequently identified 'rigidity' to be significantly associated with a network of ASD gene-encoded proteins that regulates neurite outgrowth. Gene-wide association with the well-established ASD gene MET reached significance. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for an overlapping genetic and biological etiology underlying ASDs and autistic population traits, which suggests that genetic studies in the general population may yield novel ASD genes.},

	abstract = {There have been numerous attempts to explain the enigma of autism, but existing neurocognitive theories often provide merely a refined description of 1 cluster of symptoms. Here we argue that deficits in executive functioning, theory of mind, and central coherence can all be understood as the consequence of a core deficit in the flexibility with which people with autism spectrum disorder can process violations to their expectations. More formally we argue that the human mind processes information by making and testing predictions and that the errors resulting from violations to these predictions are given a uniform, inflexibly high weight in autism spectrum disorder. The complex, fluctuating nature of regularities in the world and the stochastic and noisy biological system through which people experience it require that, in the real world, people not only learn from their errors but also need to (meta-)learn to sometimes ignore errors. Especially when situations (e.g., social) or stimuli (e.g., faces) become too complex or dynamic, people need to tolerate a certain degree of error in order to develop a more abstract level of representation. Starting from an inability to flexibly process prediction errors, a number of seemingly core deficits become logically secondary symptoms. Moreover, an insistence on sameness or the acting out of stereotyped and repetitive behaviors can be understood as attempts to provide a reassuring sense of predictive success in a world otherwise filled with error.},

However, how specific sensory responsiveness patterns are associated with symptomatology of schizophrenia remains largely unknown. The present study aimed to examine sensory responsiveness in typically-developing (TD) adolescents (n = 98) and adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) (n = 29) and investigate the relationship between schizotypal traits and sensory responsiveness patterns. All participants completed the Adult/Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP), the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Results showed that higher levels of hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity coexisted in EOS patients and were correlated with positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Atypical sensory experiences except for sensory seeking were found to be positively correlated with higher levels of schizotypal traits regardless of diagnostic status. Moreover, the strength and pattern of such correlations were comparable in both EOS and TD groups. This study also provided evidence that higher levels of autistic traits would intensify the positive correlation between schizotypal traits and sensory responsiveness abnormalities, suggesting an additive effect of co-occurring schizotypal and autistic traits on atypical sensory experiences. These findings extend previous research by depicting sensory responsiveness patterns in younger populations with schizophrenia, and may have implications for future development of sensory-related interventions in clinical settings.},

One difference often noted in these accounts is hyposensitivity to pain; however, evidence for this is limited. The purpose of the current review therefore was to examine sensitivity to pain of individuals with autism spectrum disorder. This review is interested in reports which consider differences in subjective experience of pain (i.e. different pain thresholds) and differences in behavioural response to pain (i.e. signs of pain-related distress). Studies were included if they were conducted with human subjects, included a clearly diagnosed autism spectrum disorder population and reported data pertaining to pain experience relative to the neurotypical population. Studies were classified as being self/parent report, clinical observations, observations of response to medical procedures or experimental examination of pain. Both self/parent report and clinical observations appeared to report hyposensitivity to pain, whereas observations of medical procedures and experimental manipulation suggested normal or hypersensitive responses to pain. This review suggests that contrary to classical reports, individuals with autism spectrum disorder do not appear to have systematically altered pain responses or thresholds. More systematic experimental examination of this area is needed to understand responses to pain of individuals with autism spectrum disorder.},

Precise and objective assessment of sensory processing is important for ASD diagnosis and intervention. Traditionally, the assessment is done through psychological interviews, observations, and questionnaires. While these methods have important diagnostic utility, they are subject to biases and have limited resolution. Therefore, we explored the potential of using VR, which provided objective measurements and a higher observation resolution, to assess the sensory processing differences between children with ASD and typically developing (TD). For this pilot investigation, we focused on visual and touch processing. The system can record real-time behavioral data in high temporal and spatial resolutions. An experimental study was conducted with six children with ASD and six TD children aged 11-17 years old. Results showed that the system could reveal sensory differences between these two groups. Strong and moderate correlations were observed between the system's detection and that of the most commonly used standardized psychological assessment questionnaire of sensory processing.},

The present study explores initial levels and trajectories of sensory features in ASD as well as, for comparison, typical development. Method: Growth mixture modelling was used to explore classes of autistic and typically-developing participants based on caregiver-reported total sensory behaviours on the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) at two time points, when children were aged 2-5 and 4-10 years of age, respectively. Results: Three classes are described: a mixed class of autistic and typically-developing participants with few problematic sensory behaviours (“Stable Mild”), a mostly-autistic class with more problematic sensory features (“Stable Intense”), and a small class of autistic participants whose sensory features reportedly worsened (“Increasingly Intense”). Autistic participants in the Stable Intense class exhibited high anxiety, while autistic participants in the Increasingly Intense class appeared to obtain high scores on cognitive assessments. Conclusions: The heterogeneity of sensory features and challenges found in the present study may suggest that practitioners should conduct individualized assessments of sensory features in ASD. Furthermore, practitioners should be aware of links between sensory features and anxiety in ASD, which may imply that sensory accommodations and supports could protect against anxiety. Finally, the worsening of sensory features over time in the Increasingly Intense subgroup may indicate a need for continued monitoring of changes in sensory features, perhaps especially as sensory environments change during periods of transition.},

	abstract = {Sensory reactivity is a diagnostic criterion for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and has been associated with poorer functional outcomes, behavioral difficulties, and autism severity across the lifespan. Yet, there is little consensus on best practice approaches to assessing sensory processing dysfunction in adolescents and adults with ASD. Despite growing evidence that sensory symptoms persist into adolescence and adulthood, there is a lack of norms for older age groups, and pediatric assessments may not target appropriate functional outcomes or environments. This review identified approaches used to measure sensory processing in the scientific literature, and to describe and compare these approaches to current best practice guidelines that can be incorporated into evidence-based practice. Method and Analysis: A search of scientific databases and grey literature (professional association and ASD society websites), from January 1987-May 2017, uncovered 4769 articles and 12 clinical guidelines. Study and sample characteristics were extracted, charted, and categorized according to assessment approach. Results: There were 66 articles included after article screening. Five categories of assessment approaches were identified: Self-and Proxy-Report Questionnaires, Psychophysical Assessment, Direct Behavioral Observation, Qualitative Interview Techniques, and Neuroimaging/EEG. Sensory research to date has focused on individuals with high-functioning ASD, most commonly through the use of self-report questionnaires. The Adolescent and Adult Sensory Profile (AASP) is the most widely used assessment measure (n = 22), however, a number of other assessment approaches may demonstrate strengths specific to the ASD population. Multi-method approaches to assessment (e.g., combining psychophysical or observation with questionnaires) may have clinical applicability to interdisciplinary clinical teams serving adolescents and adults with ASD. Contribution: A comprehensive knowledge of approaches is critical in the clinical assessment of a population characterized by symptomatic heterogeneity and wide-ranging cognitive profiles. This review should inform future development of international interdisciplinary clinical guidelines on sensory processing assessment in ASD across the lifespan.},

	abstract = {Recent studies highlighted that autistic individuals show increased perceptual capacity – the ability to process more information at any one time. This study examined whether there is a link between this increased perceptual capacity and the sensory hypersensitivity that many autistic people experience on a daily basis. In total, 38 autistic and 66 non-autistic adults filled in sensory questionnaires and performed an auditory load task, which assessed perceptual capacity. Results showed that higher levels of auditory perceptual capacity were correlated with higher levels of sensory sensitivities. We identified two clusters in the sample: one group of individuals with hyposensitivity and a decreased perceptual capacity (n = 42) and a cluster with an increased perceptual capacity and hypersensitivity (n = 47). Understanding this relationship may offer the opportunity to develop more effective techniques to ameliorate the often debilitating consequences of sensory hypersensitivity and over-arousal. Interestingly, this association between perceptual capacity and sensory sensitivities was seen for both groups; no significant association was found between perceptual capacity and level of autistic traits. As such, the findings may extend to other conditions with sensory atypicalities, such as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder or Williams syndrome. The practical implications of the results for many aspects of daily life, education and employment are discussed. Lay abstract: Perceptual capacity refers to the amount of information that we can pay attention to at any one time. Research has shown that autistic people have a higher perceptual capacity, which means they can take in more information than non-autistic people can. This can be useful in certain situations, for instance, hearing approaching cars or noticing small details. However, in other situations, a higher perceptual capacity may result in more distraction. This study looked at whether having this increased perceptual capacity is linked to being very sensitive to sensory information (lights, sounds, touch, taste and smell) – something that many autistic people experience on a daily basis. Being very sensitive to these things can make it hard to interact with the world around us, so it is important to know more about what causes the sensitivity. To explore this, 38 autistic and 66 non-autistic adults completed a computer task that measured perceptual capacity and filled in a questionnaire about how sensitive they were to sensory information. We found that perceptual capacity was related to sensory symptoms for both autistic and non-autistic participants; people who had a larger perceptual capacity showed more sensitivity, while people who had a lower perceptual capacity showed reduced sensory sensitivity. This information can hopefully be used to improve the way in which we can support people who experience unpleasant sensory sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Objective: The prevalence of abnormal behavioural responses to a variety of stimuli among individuals with autism has led researchers to examine whether physiological reactivity (PR) is typical in this population. This article reviewed studies assessing PR to sensory, social and emotional, and stressor stimuli in individuals with autism. Methods: Systematic searches of electronic databases identified 57 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Studies were analysed to determine: (a) participant characteristics; (b) physiological measures used; (c) PR to sensory, social and emotional or stressor stimuli; (d) the relation between PR and behavioural or psychological variables and (e) baseline physiological activity. A novel measure of methodological quality suitable for use with non-randomized, non-interventional, psychophysiological studies was also developed and applied. Results: Individuals with autism were found to respond differently than typically developing controls in 78.6\%, 66.7\% and 71.4\% of sensory, social and emotional, and stressor stimulus classes, respectively. However, this extant literature is characterized by variable and inconsistent findings, which do not appear to be accounted for by varying methodological quality, making it difficult to determine what specific factors differentiate individuals with autism who present with atypical PR from those who do not. Conclusions: Despite this uncertainty, individual differences in PR are clearly present in autism, suggesting additional research is needed to determine the variables relating to PR among those with ASD and to examine the possible existence of physiological subtype responders in the population.},

Method We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize existing research on IU with regard to anxiety and worry in young people, and to provide a context for considering future directions in this area of research. The systematic review yielded 31 studies that investigated the association of IU with either anxiety or worry in children and adolescents. Results The meta-analysis showed that IU accounted for 36.00\% of the variance in anxiety and 39.69\% in worry. Due to the low number of studies and methodological factors, examination of potential moderators was limited; and of those we were able to examine, none were significant moderators of either association. Most studies relied on questionnaire measures of IU, anxiety, and worry; all studies except one were cross-sectional and the majority of the studies were with community samples. Limitations The inclusion of eligible studies was limited to studies published in English that focus on typically developing children. Conclusions There is a strong association between IU and both anxiety and worry in young people therefore IU may be a relevant construct to target in treatment. To extend the existing literature, future research should incorporate longitudinal and experimental designs, and include samples of young people who have a range of anxiety disorders.},

Yet, no systematic review has been carried out to date to examine rates of both anxiety and depression focusing specifically on adults with ASD. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the rates of anxiety and depression in adults with ASD and the impact of factors such as assessment methods and presence of comorbid intellectual disability (ID) diagnosis on estimated prevalence rates. Electronic database searches for studies published between January 2000 and September 2017 identified a total of 35 studies, including 30 studies measuring anxiety (n = 26 070; mean age = 30.9, s.d. = 6.2 years) and 29 studies measuring depression (n = 26 117; mean age = 31.1, s.d. = 6.8 years). The pooled estimation of current and lifetime prevalence for adults with ASD were 27\% and 42\% for any anxiety disorder, and 23\% and 37\% for depressive disorder. Further analyses revealed that the use of questionnaire measures and the presence of ID may significantly influence estimates of prevalence. The current literature suffers from a high degree of heterogeneity in study method and an overreliance on clinical samples. These results highlight the importance of community-based studies and the identification and inclusion of well-characterized samples to reduce heterogeneity and bias in estimates of prevalence for comorbidity in adults with ASD and other populations with complex psychiatric presentations.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder currently lacks an explanation that bridges cognitive, computational, and neural domains. In the past 5 years, progress has been sought in this area by drawing on Bayesian probability theory to describe both social and nonsocial aspects of autism in terms of systematic differences in the processing of sensory information in the brain. The present article begins by synthesizing the existing literature in this regard, including an introduction to the topic for unfamiliar readers. The key proposal is that autism is characterized by a greater weighting of sensory information in updating probabilistic representations of the environment. Here, we unpack further how the hierarchical setting of Bayesian inference in the brain (i.e., predictive processing) adds significant depth to this approach. In particular, autism may relate to finer mechanisms involved in the context-sensitive adjustment of sensory weightings, such as in how neural representations of environmental volatility inform perception. Crucially, in light of recent sensorimotor treatments of predictive processing (i.e., active inference), hypotheses regarding atypical sensory weighting in autism have direct implications for the regulation of action and behavior. Given that core features of autism relate to how the individual interacts with and samples the world around them (e.g., reduced social responding, repetitive behaviors, motor impairments, and atypical visual sampling), the extension of Bayesian theories of autism to action will be critical for yielding insights into this condition.},

However existing accounts fail to clarify: (i) how proposed theories differ in accounts of ASD vs. schizophrenia and (ii) whether the impairments result from weaker priors or enhanced likelihoods. Here, we directly address these issues by characterizing how 91 healthy participants, scored for autistic and schizotypal traits, implicitly learned and combined priors with sensory information. This was accomplished through a visual statistical learning paradigm designed to quantitatively assess variations in individuals’ likelihoods and priors. The acquisition of the priors was found to be intact along both traits spectra. However, autistic traits were associated with more veridical perception and weaker influence of expectations. Bayesian modeling revealed that this was due, not to weaker prior expectations, but to more precise sensory representations.},

Here we show how Bayesian decision theory can account for such features and we describe a model of pain that we tested against experimental data. Our model not only agrees with placebo analgesia, but also predicts that learning can affect pain perception in other unexpected ways, which experimental evidence supports. Finally, the model can also reflect the strategies used by pain perception, showing that modulation by disparate factors is intrinsic to the pain process.},

	abstract = {The behavioral phenomena of sensory attention are thought to reflect the allocation of a limited processing resource, but there is little consensus on the nature of the resource or why it should be limited. Here we argue that a fundamental bottleneck emerges naturally within Bayesian models of perception, and use this observation to frame a new computational account of the need for, and action of, attention - unifying diverse attentional phenomena in a way that goes beyond previous inferential, probabilistic and Bayesian models. Attentional effects are most evident in cluttered environments, and include both selective phenomena, where attention is invoked by cues that point to particular stimuli, and integrative phenomena, where attention is invoked dynamically by endogenous processing. However, most previous Bayesian accounts of attention have focused on describing relatively simple experimental settings, where cues shape expectations about a small number of upcoming stimuli and thus convey "prior" information about clearly defined objects. While operationally consistent with the experiments it seeks to describe, this view of attention as prior seems to miss many essential elements of both its selective and integrative roles, and thus cannot be easily extended to complex environments. We suggest that the resource bottleneck stems from the computational intractability of exact perceptual inference in complex settings, and that attention reflects an evolved mechanism for approximate inference which can be shaped to refine the local accuracy of perception. We show that this approach extends the simple picture of attention as prior, so as to provide a unified and computationally driven account of both selective and integrative attentional phenomena. © 2012 Whiteley and Sahani.},

The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between sensory processing, repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and intolerance of uncertainty in children with ASD and those with WS to better understand the complexity of psychopathology in these disorders. Parents of 19 children with ASD and 16 children with WS, aged between 4 and 9 years, were asked to complete questionnaires assessing their children's sensory experiences, anxiety symptoms, severity and frequency of repetitive behaviors, and level of intolerance of uncertainty. Serial mediation analysis was performed. Direct significant relationships between sensory features and repetitive behaviors were found only for the ASD group.

The findings support the value of considering the complexity of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between sensory processing and repetitive behaviors across neurodevelopmental disorders and the mechanisms underlying these aspects of psychopathology in these groups.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate this association in autistic people, given the high prevalence of anxiety in this population and the limited effectiveness of therapies used currently to treat anxiety in autism. A protocol was published on the Prospero database (CRD42019125315), and electronic databases were searched using terms related to intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety and autism. Included in the systematic review were 12 studies, of which 10 were included in a meta-analysis. Results showed that anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were consistently elevated in autistic participants. Examining the correlation between these two constructs, the meta-analysis revealed a large sample-weighted effect size, r = 0.62, 95\% confidence interval = [0.52, 0.71], p {\textless} 0.001. The strength of this association was comparable to meta-analyses conducted on neurotypical populations, and therefore, it was concluded intolerance of uncertainty may be an appropriate target for intervention for autistic individuals. However, conclusions were limited due to the small number of relevant studies that were available and due to issues with methodological quality. Lay abstract: People who find it especially hard to cope with the unexpected or unknown are said to have an intolerance of uncertainty. Autistic individuals often report a preference for certainty and experience levels of anxiety that can interfere with their daily life. Understanding more about the link between the intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety in autistic people might lead to better treatments for anxiety being developed. Therefore, this work aimed to review previous research in order to explore this link. Twelve studies were found and their results were compared and contrasted. The autistic people who participated in the studies completed questionnaires that suggested a large number of them experienced very high levels of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Of 10 studies that used relevant statistics, nine found a statistically significant link between anxiety and the intolerance of uncertainty. In general, the strength of the link was about the same as previous research found in people who did not have a diagnosis of autism. This might mean that interventions that aim to help people who are intolerant of uncertainty could be effective for autistic individuals.},

This is common in certain clinical groups (e.g., autism) and varies greatly in the neurotypical population. This paper critically evaluates the concept of individual differences in sensory sensitivity, explores its possible underlying neurobiological basis, and presents a road- map for future research in this area. A distinction is made between subjective sensory sensitivity (self-reported symptoms); neural sensory sensitivity (the degree of neural activity induced by sensory stimuli); and behavioral sensory sensitivity (detection and discrimination of sensory stimuli). Whereas increased subjective and neural sensory sensitivity are assumed to increase together, the status of behavioral sensory sensitivity depends on the extent to which the increased neural activity is linked to signal or noise. A signal detection framework is presented that offers a unifying framework for exploring sensory sensitivity across different conditions. The framework is discussed, in more concrete terms, by linking it to four existing theoretical accounts of atypical sensory sensitivity (not necessarily mutually exclusive): increased excitation-to-inhibi- tion ratio; predictive coding; increased neural noise; and atypical brain connectivity.},

	abstract = {This article examines the theoretical status of latent variables as used in modern test theory models. First, it is argued that a consistent interpretation of such models requires a realist ontology for latent variables. Second, the relation between latent variables and their indicators is discussed. It is maintained that this relation can be interpreted as a causal one but that in measurement models for interindividual differences the relation does not apply to the level of the individual person. To substantiate intraindividual causal conclusions, one must explicitly represent individual level processes in the measurement model. Several research strategies that may be useful in this respect are discussed, and a typology of constructs is proposed on the basis of this analysis. The need to link individual processes to latent variable models for interindividual differences is emphasized.},

	abstract = {Prior research on the stability of sensory processing problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disabilities (DD) has produced inconsistent results. We employed a longitudinal study design to assess the stability of three clinical sensory response patterns: hyporesponsiveness; hyperresponsiveness; and sensory interests, repetitions, and seeking behaviors (SIRS). Parents of children with ASD (n = 55) or DD (n = 35) responded to sensory questionnaires at two time points (T1 and T2) separated by 3.3 years on average, with the children aged 2–12 years (M = 5.69 ± 2.46) at the first assessment. For each sensory response pattern, regression analysis revealed that, for both ASD and DD groups, scores at T1 were strong predictors of scores at T2. Over the longitudinal assessment interval, there was a significant mean decline in severity for SIRS in both groups and for hyporesponsiveness in the ASD group. Parental estimates of the amount of therapy services received were positively associated with the severity of sensory features at T2, an outcome that may result from increased intervention dosages being administered to children who fail to improve over time. The results are discussed in terms of person-centered and environmental considerations, which, in combination, have the capacity to affect stability outcomes for sensory features. Autism Research 2019, 12: 100–111. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Lay Summary: Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other developmental disabilities (DD) may process sensory information differently from those who do not have ASD. For example, some children may be over-responsive or under-responsive to sound or touch. In this study, we showed that sensory features in preschool/school-aged children with ASD and DD tend to decrease on average over a several year period. However, individual children tend to retain their ranking (low or high in sensory features) in comparison to other children over time.},

Method: The parents of 6,539 children in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children completed the Social and Communication Disorders Checklist at ages 7, 10, and 13. The phenotypic progression of autistic traits was assessed in the full sample and in high-scoring individuals (e.g., top 10\%, 5\%). Gender, IQ, and overall behavior difficulties were examined as potentially relevant influences on autistic trait trajectories. Results: Autistic traits were highly stable in the general population overall and in the high-scoring groups. In the full sample, there was no change in mean Social and Communication Disorders Checklist scores for female subjects ages 7 to 13 (p = .43). Scores for male subjects decreased slightly, but significantly, on the order of 0.1 standard deviations (p {\textless} .001). There was no mean change in parent-rated autistic traits within any of the high-scoring groups. IQ was not related to phenotypic progression; high parent-rated behavior problems predicted slight improvement in Social and Communication Disorders Checklist scores over the course of the study period in high-scoring individuals (p {\textless} .01). Conclusions: These findings suggest that autistic traits are highly stable in the general population, even in individuals with the highest concentrations of autism-like behaviors. Phenotypic stability is consistent with expectations for individuals with autism spectrum disorders, providing further support for a phenomenologic continuum across the clinical threshold. Moreover, the gap between female and male risk for autistic symptomology is consistent over time. © 2011 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},

Previous research suggests that sensory problems and anxiety may be related to the development and maintenance of sleep problems in children with ASD. However, the relationships among these co-occurring conditions have not been previously studied. The current study examined the interrelations of these symptoms in a large well-characterized sample of children and adolescents with ASD. Methods: The current study examined the relationships among sleep problems, sensory over-responsivity, and anxiety in 1347 children enrolled in the Autism Speaks Autism Treatment Network. The primary measures included the Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire, the Child Behavior Checklist, and the Short Sensory Profile. Results: In bivariate correlations and multivariate path analyses, anxiety was associated with all types of sleep problems (ie, bedtime resistance, sleep-onset delay, sleep duration, sleep anxiety, and night wakings; p {\textless} 0.01 to p {\textless} 0.001; small to medium effect sizes). Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) was correlated with all sleep problems in bivariate analyses (p {\textless} 0.01 to p {\textless} 0.001; small effect sizes). In multivariate path models, SOR remained significantly associated with all sleep problems except night awakenings for older children, while SOR was no longer significantly associated with bedtime resistance or sleep anxiety for younger children. Conclusions: Children with ASD who have anxiety and SOR may be particularly predisposed to sleep problems. These findings suggest that some children with ASD and sleep disturbance may have difficulties with hyperarousal. Future research using physiological measures of arousal and objective measures of sleep are needed.},

The Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) is a widely used questionnaire administered by parents or caregivers to assess RRBs in individuals with ASD. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the RBS-R Japanese Version (RBS-R-J). The ASD and non-ASD groups comprised 274 and 36 participants, respectively. We examined corrected item-total correlation, Cronbach's alpha, and RBS-R-J scores of different diagnostic groups, as well as correlations between RBS-R-J scores and intelligence quotient (IQ), autistic symptoms, adaptive/maladaptive functioning, aberrant behaviors, and sensory processing. All items showed moderate corrected item-total correlations. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was.93. We found significant differences in the mean RBS-R-J scores of the low-functioning ASD group and the intellectual disabilities group, and of low-functioning and high-functioning ASD groups. RBS-R-J scores negatively correlated with IQ and scores on the Sensory Profile (Japanese version) and Adaptive Behavior Composite of the Maladaptive Behavior Index of the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-Second Edition (VABS-II; Japanese version), but positively correlated with scores on the peak and current symptoms subscales of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale, the VABS-II, and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Community (Japanese version). From these results, we conclude that RBS-R-J showed good reliability, diagnostic validity, and convergent validity, indicating that it is a reliable, valid instrument for use among ASD individuals in clinical and research settings.},

However, synaptic noise arising from variable transmission can improve, in certain restricted conditions, information transmission. Under broader conditions, it can improve information transmission per release, a quantity that is relevant given the energetic constraints on computing in the brain.

The results revealed that Japanese students indicated greater autism-related stigma than US students, which was not attributable to differences in autism knowledge, prior experience with autism, or college major. In both countries, students majoring in “helping professions” exhibited greater willingness to engage with people with autism. Japanese and US students varied in their misconceptions about autism, with significant differences on about half of the knowledge items. Japanese students showed decreased stigma after completing the autism training, yet continued to exhibit greater social distance towards people with autism relative to US students.

Methods We compared 118 Chinese parents of children with ASD to 122 demographic-matched parents of typically developing children on measures of self-esteem, social support, and life satisfaction using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (SES), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), respectively. Results Parents of children with ASD scored significantly lower on self-esteem, social support, and life satisfaction than the controls (ps {\textless} 0.01), and social support partly mediated the relationship between self-esteem and life satisfaction in both groups. Hierarchical regressions indicated that after controlling for demographic variables, social support and self-esteem were significant predictors of life satisfaction in both groups but explained more variance in life satisfaction for the parents of children with ASD. Conclusions Social support and self-esteem play a more important role in life satisfaction for parents of children with ASD than those of typically developing children. Life satisfaction is positively related to higher household income, higher self-esteem, and stronger social support for parents. Self-esteem is likely to be associated with greater life satisfaction by means of greater social support. Future research and interventions should focus on fostering a more positive climate of social support for ASD families in China.},

Observers recorded children's social and play behavior during free play activities in their preschool, and teachers rated their social behavior. Korean-American mothers completed an acculturation measure. Results showed Korean-American mothers who had an 'assimilated' acculturation style, were more accepting and encouraging of children's creativity and play, and reported more parent-child play in the home than mothers with an integrated, marginal, or separated acculturation styles. Children of assimilated and integrated mothers engaged in more frequent pretend play and were rated by their teachers as being more difficult. The results suggest there are distinct cultures of family life and childhood that manifest themselves as Korean immigrant families individually adapt to life in the U.S. The findings support the importance of examining cultural differences that exist between people whose ancestry can be traced to the same nationality.},

ASDs include autism, pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), Rett syndrome and Asperger disorder.

Recent parent-reported diagnosis of ASD in the United States put it at higher levels (1:91) than previously thought, with its diagnosis in boys occurring 4 to 5 times more frequently than in girls (1:58).1 CDC estimates are currently 1:110;1 up from 1:150 in 2007.2 Annual medical expenditures for those affected are generally four to six times greater than for those without ASD.1 While twin studies demonstrate that genetics play a significant role in ASD, the impact of environment should not be underestimated, given the approximate 20-fold increase in incidence over the last 20 years.3.},

	abstract = {Background: The prevalence of autism spectrum conditions (ASC) is 1\% in developed countries, but little data are available from mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. This study synthesizes evidence relating to the prevalence of ASC in these areas and assesses the effects of research methodology on prevalence estimates. Methods. Systematic literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Knowledge, China Web of Knowledge and Weipu databases, as well as relevant papers published from 1987 to 2011, reporting prevalence estimates of ASC or childhood autism in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Summary estimates of prevalence were calculated with a random effects model. The effects of research methodology on the prevalence estimates were assessed using a meta-regression model. Results: There were 25 studies eligible for review, 18 of which were suitable for inclusion in a meta-analysis. Pooled prevalence of childhood autism was 11.8 per 10,000 individuals (95\% confidence interval (CI): 8.2, 15.3) in mainland China. Pooled prevalence of ASC was 26.6 per 10,000 (95\% CI: 18.5, 34.6) in three areas. Substantial heterogeneity was identified between studies (I 2{\textgreater}75\%). The prevalence estimate of childhood autism was most strongly associated with the choice of screening instrument. After adjustment for age group, the odds ratio for prevalence estimates when using the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC) as the screening instrument compared with those using the Clancy Autism Behavior Scale (CABS) was 0.29 (95\% CI: 0.12, 0.69), and 1.79 (95\% CI: 0.70, 4.55; P= 0.20) when using the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (CHAT) compared to the CABS. Conclusions: The available studies investigating the prevalence of ASC in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan have focused mainly on childhood autism rather than the whole spectrum. The prevalence estimates are lower than estimates from developed countries. Studies using more recently developed screening instruments reported higher prevalence than older ones. However, available studies have methodological weaknesses and therefore these results lack comparability with those from developed countries. Our findings indicate a potential under-diagnosis and under-detection of ASC in mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, and a need to adopt more advanced methods for research of ASC in these areas. © 2013 Sun et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

To support the social participation of students with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) it is essential to understand their emotional life in the context of ethnic and school cultures. We are particularly interested in how anxiety and loneliness are experienced in developing and maintaining friendships in the daily encounters of adolescents with ASD in the specific context of Japanese schools, because these emotions could serve either as facilitators or barriers to social interaction, depending on how individuals manage them. The present qualitative study investigated perceptions of emotions related to friendship in the everyday school life of 11 adolescents with ASD in Japan. Data were collected by means of semi-structured individual interviews, which revealed a wide range of motivations for socialization, limited future prospects to deepen friendships, robust self-awareness of one’s own social challenges, and conscious efforts to cope with these challenges. An inductive approach to data analysis resulted in four themes: social motivation, loneliness, anxiety, and distress. To our knowledge this is the first study to uncover the rich emotional life of adolescents with ASD in the context of their friendships in an Asian culture.},

The current study's aims were: To examine the frequency of elevated anxiety symptoms in adolescents diagnosed with ASD in toddlerhood; To explore the impact of comorbid anxiety in adolescents on clinical presentation; To evaluate variables in toddlerhood that associate with anxiety symptom severity in adolescence. The study included 61 adolescents (mean age = 13:8y) diagnosed with ASD in toddlerhood (T1). Participants underwent a comprehensive assessment of cognitive ability, adaptive skills and autism severity at T1 and again as adolescents (T2), and an evaluation of anxiety symptoms at T2. For the first aim, the most prevalent anxiety subtypes noted in adolescence were separation (39.3\%), social (27.9\%) and generalized anxiety (18.0\%). For the second aim, cognitive ability, autism severity and adaptive skills in adolescents with and without elevated anxiety symptoms scores of any type did not differ significantly. For the third aim, younger age at adolescence was associated with more severe separation and generalized anxiety symptoms. Higher cognitive ability and adaptive skills in toddlerhood were associated with elevated generalized anxiety symptoms in adolescence. Lower adaptive behaviors and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) correlated with elevated social anxiety symptoms. Lower cognitive abilities and more severe RRBs in toddlerhood predicted separation anxiety in adolescence. The study sheds light on early characteristics in ASD that associate with anxiety symptom severity in adolescence.

Understanding the underlying traits of anxiety in autism spectrum disorder is crucial to prevent and treat it efficiently. Hence, this study determined whether social communication difficulties or restricted repetitive behaviors are stronger risk factors for anxiety symptoms in autistic adults in a large cohort. Data on 742 autistic adults from the Netherlands Autism Register were included in the study. Hierarchical regression was implemented to evaluate whether social communication difficulties (Autism-Spectrum Quotient social behavior factor) and restricted repetitive behaviors (Adult Routines Inventory) were predictive of anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) controlling for age and sex. When considered together, restricted repetitive behaviors stood out as significant positive predictors of anxiety symptoms (lower-order restricted repetitive behaviors, β = 0.32, p {\textless} 0.001; higher-order restricted repetitive behaviors, β = 0.15, p = 0.001), whereas social communication difficulties did not (β = 0.06, p = 0.11). Sex did not moderate these associations (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Non-social autistic traits are stronger predictors of anxiety symptoms than social traits in autistic adults. Increased attention to restricted repetitive behaviors should be given to improve current support programs for autistic adults with anxiety and to identify autistic individuals at risk.},

These systems are increasingly receiving attention as an innovative medium for delivering interventions to children with autism spectrum disorder. Although many virtual reality systems are commercially available and their use is increasing, little is known about the safety and usability of these systems for children with autism spectrum disorder. The aim of this study was a first step in addressing this gap. A convenience sample of 35 children with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder participated in an immersive head-mounted display virtual reality experience and a control condition (monitor-displayed video). Levels of anxiety and negative effects experienced were not significantly different between the two conditions. Participants reported significantly enhanced spatial presence (p = 0.003; d = 0.3) and naturalness (p = 0.002; d = 0.47) for the head-mounted display–virtual reality condition, and 74\% of participants preferred using head-mounted display–virtual reality over monitor-displayed video. These findings provide preliminary evidence to support the safety and usability of head-mounted display–virtual reality for children with autism spectrum disorder. Future studies are needed to replicate the results in a larger sample, a range of virtual reality experiences, and in the context of long-term exposure. Lay abstract: This study investigated the safety and usability of a virtual reality experience for children with autism spectrum disorder in a laboratory setting. In our study, the negative effects of head-mounted display–virtual reality were similar to monitor-displayed video watching. At the same time, the participants indicated that the head-mounted display–virtual reality experience provided improved realism and sense of presence.

	abstract = {Objectives: To update UK studies begun in the early 1990s on the annual prevalence and incidence rates of autism in children; undertaken in response to a March 2012 press release, widely covered by the media, from the US Centre for Disease Control (CDC) reporting that the autism prevalence rate in 2008 in 8-year-old US children was 1 in 88, a 78\% increase from a CDC estimate in 2004. This finding suggested a continuation of the dramatic increase in children diagnosed as autistic, which occurred in the 1990s. Design: Population study using the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD). Methods: Annual autism prevalence rates were estimated for children aged 8 years in 2004-2010 by dividing the number diagnosed as autistic in each or any previous year by the number of children active in the study population that year. We also calculated annual incidence rates for children aged 2-8 years, by dividing the number newly diagnosed in 2004-2010 by the same denominators. Results: Annual prevalence rates for each year were steady at approximately 3.8/1000 boys and 0.8/1000 girls. Annual incidence rates each year were also steady at about 1.2/1000 boys and 0.2/1000 girls. Conclusions: Following a fivefold increase in the annual incidence rates of autism during the 1990s in the UK, the incidence and prevalence rates in 8-year-old children reached a plateau in the early 2000s and remained steady through 2010. Whether prevalence rates have increased from the early 2000s in the USA remains uncertain.},

This can assist deciding between factor analytical and network theories of intelligence, e.g. g theory versus mutualism theory. The second application uses the ‘Holzinger and Swineford data’ and illustrates how to cross-validate a network. The third application concerns a multigroup analysis on scores on the Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BCATC). It exemplifies how to test if network parameters have the same values across groups. Of theoretical interest is that in all applications psychometric network models outperformed previously established (g) factor models. Simulations showed that this was unlikely due to overparameterization. Thus the overall results were more consistent with mutualism theory than with mainstream g theory.

Findings are complex and do not always relate to each other in a straightforward manner. Distinct but interlinked questions on the relationship between sex/gender differences and autism remain underaddressed. To better understand the implications from existing research and to help design future studies, we propose a 4-level conceptual framework to clarify the embedded themes. Method We searched PubMed for publications before September 2014 using search terms “‘sex OR gender OR females’ AND autism.” A total of 1,906 articles were screened for relevance, along with publications identified via additional literature reviews, resulting in 329 articles that were reviewed. Results Level 1, “Nosological and diagnostic challenges,” concerns the question, “How should autism be defined and diagnosed in males and females?” Level 2, “Sex/gender-independent and sex/gender-dependent characteristics,” addresses the question, “What are the similarities and differences between males and females with autism?” Level 3, “General models of etiology: liability and threshold,” asks the question, “How is the liability for developing autism linked to sex/gender?” Level 4, “Specific etiological–developmental mechanisms,” focuses on the question, “What etiological–developmental mechanisms of autism are implicated by sex/gender and/or sexual/gender differentiation?” Conclusions Using this conceptual framework, findings can be more clearly summarized, and the implications of the links between findings from different levels can become clearer. Based on this 4-level framework, we suggest future research directions, methodology, and specific topics in sex/gender differences and autism.},

Unfortunately, most previous work on the RMSEA and its confidence interval has focused on models with a large df. Building on the work of Chen et al. to examine the impact of small df on the RMSEA, we conducted a theoretical analysis and a Monte Carlo simulation using correctly specified models with varying df and sample size. The results of our investigation indicate that when the cutoff values are used to assess the fit of the properly specified models with small df and small sample size, the RMSEA too often falsely indicates a poor fitting model. We recommend not computing the RMSEA for small df models, especially those with small sample sizes, but rather estimating parameters that were not originally specified in the model.},

	doi = {10.1198/jcgs.2010.08111},
	abstract = {Model-based clustering consists of fitting a mixture model to data and identifying each cluster with one of its components. Multivariate normal distributions are typically used. The number of clusters is usually determined from the data, often using BIC. In practice, however, individual clusters can be poorly fitted by Gaussian distributions, and in that case model-based clustering tends to represent one non-Gaussian cluster by a mixture of two or more Gaussian distributions. If the number of mixture components is interpreted as the number of clusters, this can lead to overestimation of the number of clusters. This is because BIC selects the number of mixture components needed to provide a good approximation to the density, rather than the number of clusters as such. We propose first selecting the total number of Gaussian mixture components, K, using BIC and then combining them hierarchically according to an entropy criterion. This yields a unique soft clustering for each number of clusters less than or equal to K. These clusterings can be compared on substantive grounds, and we also describe an automatic way of selecting the number of clusters via a piecewise linear regression fit to the rescaled entropy plot. We illustrate the method with simulated data and a flow cytometry dataset.

	abstract = {Mixture modeling is a widely applied data analysis technique used to identify unobserved heterogeneity in a population. Despite mixture models' usefulness in practice, one unresolved issue in the application of mixture models is that there is not one commonly accepted statistical indicator for deciding on the number of classes in a study population. This article presents the results of a simulation study that examines the performance of likelihood-based tests and the traditionally used Information Criterion (ICs) used for determining the number of classes in mixture modeling. We look at the performance of these tests and indexes for 3 types of mixture models: latent class analysis (LCA), a factor mixture model (FMA), and a growth mixture models (GMM). We evaluate the ability of the tests and indexes to correctly identify the number of classes at three different sample sizes (n = 200, 500, 1,000). Whereas the Bayesian Information Criterion performed the best of the ICs, the bootstrap likelihood ratio test proved to be a very consistent indicator of classes across all of the models considered.

	abstract = {The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity of proposed DSM-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We analyzed symptoms from 14,744 siblings (8,911 ASD and 5,863 non-ASD) included in a national registry, the Interactive Autism Network. Youth 2 through 18 years of age were included if at least one child in the family was diagnosed with ASD. Caregivers reported symptoms using the Social Responsiveness Scale and the Social Communication Questionnaire. The structure of autism symptoms was examined using latent variable models that included categories, dimensions, or hybrid models specifying categories and subdimensions. Diagnostic efficiency statistics evaluated the proposed DSM-5 algorithm in identifying ASD. A hybrid model that included both a category (ASD versus non-ASD) and two symptom dimensions (social communication/interaction and restricted/repetitive behaviors) was more parsimonious than all other models and replicated across measures and subsamples. Empirical classifications from this hybrid model closely mirrored clinical ASD diagnoses (90\% overlap), implying a broad ASD category distinct from non-ASD. DSM-5 criteria had superior specificity relative to DSM-IV-TR criteria (0.97 versus 0.86); however sensitivity was lower (0.81 versus 0.95). Relaxing DSM-5 criteria by requiring one less symptom criterion increased sensitivity (0.93 versus 0.81), with minimal reduction in specificity (0.95 versus 0.97). Results supported the validity of proposed DSM-5 criteria for ASD as provided in Phase I Field Trials criteria. Increased specificity of DSM-5 relative to DSM-IV-TR may reduce false positive diagnoses, a particularly relevant consideration for low base rate clinical settings. Phase II testing of DSM-5 should consider a relaxed algorithm, without which as many as 12\% of ASD-affected individuals, particularly females, will be missed. Relaxed DSM-5 criteria may improve identification of ASD, decreasing societal costs through appropriate early diagnosis and maximizing intervention resources. © 2012 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by notable phenotypic heterogeneity, which is often viewed as an obstacle to the study of its etiology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. On the basis of empirical evidence, instead of three binary categories, the upcoming edition of the DSM 5 will use two dimensions - social communication deficits (SCD) and fixated interests and repetitive behaviors (FIRB) - for the ASD diagnostic criteria. Building on this proposed DSM 5 model, it would be useful to consider whether empirical data on the SCD and FIRB dimensions can be used within the novel methodological framework of Factor Mixture Modeling (FMM) to stratify children with ASD into more homogeneous subgroups. Methods: The study sample consisted of 391 newly diagnosed children (mean age 38.3 months; 330 males) with ASD. To derive subgroups, data from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised indexing SCD and FIRB were used in FMM; FMM allows the examination of continuous dimensions and latent classes (i.e., categories) using both factor analysis (FA) and latent class analysis (LCA) as part of a single analytic framework. Results: Competing LCA, FA, and FMM models were fit to the data. On the basis of a set of goodness-of-fit criteria, a 'two-factor/three-class' factor mixture model provided the overall best fit to the data. This model describes ASD using three subgroups/classes (Class 1: 34\%, Class 2: 10\%, Class 3: 56\% of the sample) based on differential severity gradients on the SCD and FIRB symptom dimensions. In addition to having different symptom severity levels, children from these subgroups were diagnosed at different ages and were functioning at different adaptive, language, and cognitive levels. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that the two symptom dimensions of SCD and FIRB proposed for the DSM 5 can be used in FMM to stratify children with ASD empirically into three relatively homogeneous subgroups. © 2012 Association for Child and Adolescent Mental Health.},

EOE and LST were related to autism symptoms, alexithymia, anxiety, and depression. AES was related to attention to details (a symptom of autism) and anxiety but not to depression. It was also negatively related to externally-oriented thinking (a symptom of alexithymia). Results indicate that AES is conceptually distinct from LST and EOE. Furthermore, EOE interacted with difficulty identifying feelings in predicting anxiety, indicating that being both easily excited by stimuli and unable to identify one's feelings is particularly anxiety provoking. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Method: Children with autistic disorder (AD; n = 72, mean age = 52.3 months) and other DDs (n = 44, mean age = 48.1 months) participated in a protocol measuring sensory response patterns; social-communicative symptoms of autism; and language, social, and communication skills. Results: Hyporesponsiveness was positively associated with social-communicative symptom severity, with no significant group difference in the association. Hyperresponsiveness was not significantly associated with social-communicative symptom severity. A group difference emerged for sensory seeking and social-communicative symptom severity, with a positive association for the AD group only. For the 2 groups of children combined, hyporesponsiveness was negatively associated with language skills and social adaptive skills. Sensory seeking also was negatively associated with language skills. These associations did not differ between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Aberrant sensory processing may play an important role in the pathogenesis of autism and other DDs as well as in the rate of acquisition of language, social, and communication skills. © American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.},

	abstract = {This study argues that there exists, in the general population, a distinctive profile of cognitive traits that predisposes people to develop synaesthesia (termed a ‘synaesthetic disposition’). This consists of more vivid mental imagery, better episodic memory, and greater attention-to-detail (amongst others things). Using a machine-learning classifier, we show that it is possible to distinguish synaesthetes from others using only standard cognitive and personality measures. Importantly, people with multiple forms of synaesthesia have a more distinctive profile (i.e., they can be more accurately classified). This suggests that whilst the presence/absence of synaesthesia is dichotomous, the underlying causal mechanisms are continuous. Moreover, we provide evidence that the cognitive profile constitutes a heritable endophenotype. Non-synaesthetic relatives of synaesthetes are cognitively similar to synaesthetes. This provides new insights into why synaesthesia might have evolved (i.e., it is possible to have the cognitive benefits of synaesthesia in the absence of the anomalous experiences). The notion of a synaesthetic disposition represents a novel, quantifiable individual difference in cognition/personality. This paves the way for determining if this is linked to a distinctive pattern of clinical vulnerabilities.},

Autism (shorthand for Autism Spectrum Conditions) is a neurodevelopmental condition involving social-communication disability alongside resistance to change and unusually narrow interests or activities. Whilst on the surface they appear distinct, they have been suggested to share common atypical neural connectivity. Methods. In the present study, we carried out the first prevalence study of synaesthesia in autism to formally test whether these conditions are independent. After exclusions, 164 adults with autism and 97 controls completed a synaesthesia questionnaire, Autism Spectrum Quotient, and Test of Genuineness-Revised (ToG-R) online. Results: The rate of synaesthesia in adults with autism was 18.9\% (31 out of 164), almost three times greater than in controls (7.22\%, 7 out of 97, P {\textless}0.05). ToG-R proved unsuitable for synaesthetes with autism. Conclusions: The significant increase in synaesthesia prevalence in autism suggests that the two conditions may share some common underlying mechanisms.

Synaesthesia is highly prevalent among individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the mechanisms of this co-occurrence are not clear. We hypothesized autism and synaesthesia share atypical sensory sensitivity and perception. We assessed autistic traits, sensory sensitivity and visual perception in two synaesthete populations. In Study 1, synaesthetes ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 79, of different types) scored higher than non-synaesthetes ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 76) on the Attention-to-detail and Social skills subscales of the autism spectrum quotient indexing autistic traits, and on the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire indexing sensory hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity which frequently occur in autism. Synaesthetes performed two local/global visual tasks because individuals with autism typically show a bias towards detail processing. In synaesthetes, elevated motion coherence thresholds (MCTs) suggested reduced global motion perception, and higher accuracy on an embedded figures task suggested enhanced local perception. In Study 2, sequence-space synaesthetes ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 18) completed the same tasks. Questionnaire and embedded figures results qualitatively resembled Study 1 results, but no significant group differences with non-synaesthetes ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 20) were obtained. Unexpectedly, sequence-space synaesthetes had reduced MCTs.

Currently, the overlap between synaesthesia and autism is established most convincingly at the level of alterations in sensory sensitivity and perception, with synaesthetes showing autism-like profiles of sensory sensitivity and a bias towards details in perception. Shared features may include a predominance of local over global connectivity in the brain. When autism and synaesthesia co-occur in the same individual, the chance of developing heightened cognitive and memory abilities is increased. We discuss how the same theoretical models could potentially explain both conditions.

However, relatively little is known about its phenomenology or neurocognitive underpinnings. The present article synthesizes a large body of literature on the phenomenology and pathophysiology of DST-related conditions to generate a comprehensive theoretical account of DST in autism. Notably, we argue against conceptualizing DST as a unified construct, suggesting that it be separated into three phenomenologically distinct conditions: hyperacusis (the perception of everyday sounds as excessively loud or painful), misophonia (an acquired aversive reaction to specific sounds), and phonophobia (a specific phobia of sound), each responsible for a portion of observed DST behaviors. We further elaborate our framework by proposing preliminary neurocognitive models of hyperacusis, misophonia, and phonophobia that incorporate neurophysiologic findings from studies of autism.},

	abstract = {Atypical sensory perception and heterogeneous cognitive profiles are common features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, previous findings on auditory sensory processing in ASD are mixed. Accordingly, auditory perception and its relation to cognitive abilities in ASD remain poorly understood. Here, children with ASD, and age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched typically developing children, were tested on a low- and a higher level pitch processing task. Verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities were measured using the Wechsler’s Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. There were no group differences in performance on either auditory task or IQ measure. However, there was significant variability in performance on the auditory tasks in both groups that was predicted by nonverbal, not verbal skills. These results suggest that auditory perception is related to nonverbal reasoning rather than verbal abilities in ASD and typically developing children. In addition, these findings provide evidence for preserved pitch processing in school-age children with ASD with average IQ, supporting the idea that there may be a subgroup of individuals with ASD that do not present perceptual or cognitive difficulties. Future directions involve examining whether similar perceptual-cognitive relationships might be observed in a broader sample of individuals with ASD, such as those with language impairment or lower IQ.},

	abstract = {Background: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by socio-communicative difficulties and restricted patterns of behavior. Despite these challenges, some individuals with ASD have preserved or even enhanced sensory skills, for example in the case of music. As such, music provides a key way to study sensory processing and individual differences in ASD. However, current studies of music perception in ASD have mixed results. Methods: This study sought to examine music perception in terms of melodic pitch, rhythm, and memory in school-age children with ASD compared to typically-developing (TD) children. Music perception was investigated as a function of verbal and non-verbal IQ, age, and ASD social symptom severity. Results: Children with ASD performed similar to TD children on melodic pitch perception, rhythm perception and melodic memory. Melodic pitch perception in particular was strongly associated with non-verbal cognitive abilities in the ASD group. Similar effects of age on performance were observed in ASD and TD; in particular, rhythm discrimination increased with age in both groups. Music perception in ASD was not associated with ASD social symptom severity. Discussion: These findings provide further evidence for intact melodic and rhythmic perception in children with ASD. In addition, music perception abilities were related to non-verbal cognitive ability and age in ASD, and not with ASD social symptom severity. This research provides a better understanding of individual differences in auditory processing, helps to better define phenotypes in ASD, and can guide future studies on the effects of music therapy in ASD.},

We aimed to create a quantitative summary of previous findings and investigate potential factors, which could explain the variable results found in the literature investigating biological motion perception in autism. Methods: A search from five electronic databases yielded 52 papers eligible for a quantitative summarisation, including behavioural, eye-tracking, electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Results: Using a three-level random effects meta-analytic approach, we found that individuals with autism generally showed decreased performance in perception and interpretation of biological motion. Results additionally suggest decreased performance when higher order information, such as emotion, is required. Moreover, with the increase of age, the difference between autistic and neurotypical individuals decreases, with children showing the largest effect size overall. Conclusion: We highlight the need for methodological standards and clear distinctions between the age groups and paradigms utilised when trying to interpret differences between the two populations.},

We investigated the role of MT in visual perception by examining the effect of chemical lesions of MT on psychophysical thresholds. We trained rhesus monkeys on psychophysical tasks that enabled us to assess their sensitivity to motion and to contrast. For motion psychophysics, we employed a dynamic random dot display that permitted us to vary the intensity of a motion signal in the midst of masking motion noise. We measured the threshold intensity for which the monkey could successfully complete a direction discrimination. In the contrast task, we measured the threshold contrast for which the monkeys could successfully discriminate the orientation of stationary gratings. Injections of ibotenic acid into MT caused striking elevations in motion thresholds, but had little or no effect on contrast thresholds. The results indicate that neural activity in MT contributes selectively to the perception of motion.},

	abstract = {Children with autism spectrum disorders often exhibit co-occurring sensory processing problems and receive interventions that target self-regulation. In current practice, sensory interventions apply different theoretic constructs, focus on different goals, use a variety of sensory modalities, and involve markedly disparate procedures. Previous reviews examined the effects of sensory interventions without acknowledging these inconsistencies. This systematic review examined the research evidence (2000-2012) of two forms of sensory interventions, sensory integration therapy and sensory-based intervention, for children with autism spectrum disorders and concurrent sensory processing problems. A total of 19 studies were reviewed: 5 examined the effects of sensory integration therapy and 14 sensory-based intervention. The studies defined sensory integration therapies as clinic-based interventions that use sensory-rich, child-directed activities to improve a child's adaptive responses to sensory experiences. Two randomized controlled trials found positive effects for sensory integration therapy on child performance using Goal Attainment Scaling (effect sizes ranging from.72 to 1.62); other studies (Levels III-IV) found positive effects on reducing behaviors linked to sensory problems. Sensory-based interventions are characterized as classroom-based interventions that use single-sensory strategies, for example, weighted vests or therapy balls, to influence a child's state of arousal. Few positive effects were found in sensory-based intervention studies. Studies of sensory-based interventions suggest that they may not be effective; however, they did not follow recommended protocols or target sensory processing problems. Although small randomized controlled trials resulted in positive effects for sensory integration therapies, additional rigorous trials using manualized protocols for sensory integration therapy are needed to evaluate effects for children with autism spectrum disorders and sensory processing problems.},

This study used the Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) Standards for Evidence-based Practices in Special Education to evaluate the effectiveness research from 2006 to 2017 on Ayres Sensory Integration (ASI) intervention for children with autism. A systematic review was conducted in three stages. Stage 1 involved an extensive database search for relevant studies using search terms related to sensory integration and autism, interventions suggesting a sensory integration approach, and high-quality study designs. Searches yielded 19 studies that were evaluated in Stage 2. Six of these met inclusion criteria of being peer-reviewed, written in English, description of intervention this is consistent with ASI intervention, and comparison group design or single subject method employed. Prior to analysis using CEC standards, three articles were excluded because intervention details were not consistent with the core principles of ASI, or because of major methodological flaws. In Stage 3, the remaining three studies were rated using the CEC quality indicators and standards for an evidence-based practice. Two randomized controlled trials respectively met 100\% and 85\% of the CEC criteria items. One additional study met more than 50\% of the criteria.

Raters were trained to score therapist strategies observed in video recordings of adultchild dyads. We examined content validity through expert ratings. RESULTS. Reliability of the process section was strong for total fidelity score (ICC = .99, Cronbach's α = .99) and acceptable for most items. Total score significantly differentiated ASI from four alternative interventions. Expert ratings indicated strong agreement that items in the structural and process sections represent ASI intervention. CONCLUSION. The Ayres Sensory Integration Fidelity Measure has strong content validity. The process section is reliable and valid when scored by trained raters with expertise in ASI.},

Sensory processing has been shown to be atypical in ASD, yet physiological processing and subjective experience of internal sensation processing, namely interoception, has not been reported sufficiently in research or clinical settings. Background There is a small but growing body of scientific research on interoception in ASD, which is relevant to understanding the behavioral and cognitive characteristics inherent in this condition, and may provide a foundation for clinical interventions such as biofeedback, pain management, and brain stimulation techniques. Methods A literature review of original research was performed using major scientific databases. Results Interoception, which occurs due to multisensory connections and integration of internal afferents in cortical and subcortical areas, is atypical in ASD, but the degree and directionality of this abnormality is not yet clear due to the heterogeneity of the condition. Between-group interoceptive differences in individuals with and without ASD have been repeatedly demonstrated, with a slight tendency towards hyporeactivity in interoceptive awareness in individuals with ASD. Significance Multidimensional research combining neuroimaging with psychophysiological and self-report measures guided by a clear theoretical model is necessary to understand how interoceptive differences link to the behavioral and cognitive characteristics of ASD. Sensory processing models and autism theory should also be updated to incorporate these recent findings.},

Behavioral coding was used to determine what activity contexts, sensory modalities, and stimulus characteristics were associated with specific behavior types: hyperresponsive, hyporesponsive, sensory seeking, and repetitive/stereotypic. Results indicated that hyperresponsive behaviors were most associated with activities of daily living and family-initiated stimuli, whereas sensory seeking behaviors were associated with free play activities and child-initiated stimuli. Behaviors associated with multiple sensory modalities simultaneously were common, emphasizing the multi-sensory nature of children's behaviors in natural contexts.

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by a detail-driven visual processing strategy, evidence for which has been based largely on cross-sectional studies in small participant groups of limited age ranges. It is therefore unknown when sensitivity to detailed information emerges and develops in ASD. Contrast sensitivity to sinusoidal gratings of different spatial frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 cycles per degree (cpd)) was measured for 34 participants with ASD and 55 typically developing participants (aged 6–16 years). Cross-sectional, developmental trajectories were constructed to examine within and between group differences across the range of spatial frequencies tested. Developmental trajectories indicated that sensitivity across low (i.e., 0.5 and 1 cpd) and mid (2 and 4 cpd) spatial frequencies varied by chronological age within each group, with mid frequencies developing at a more significant rate than low frequencies. There was no overall difference between groups in terms of the relationship of sensitivity and age across spatial frequencies, yet the ASD group had an overall lower level of sensitivity. Closer examination revealed that the youngest participants with ASD had a reduced sensitivity for mid frequencies. Moreover, the ASD group showed a statistically significant developmental relationship at 8 cpd, which suggests that a trend for increased sensitivity to early detailed information may manifest beyond the ages tested. These findings demonstrate a differential development of contrast sensitivity for spatial frequencies in ASD and underscore the need to better identify what drives such differences in the “building blocks” of visual perception.

Normal observers can differ in this ability by at least a factor of 4, yet this variation is typically overlooked, and has never been convincingly explained. This study uses two techniques to investigate the main source of individual variations in contrast sensitivity. First, a noise masking experiment assessed whether differences were due to the observer's internal noise, or the efficiency with which they extracted information from the stimulus. Second, contrast discrimination functions from 18 previous studies were compared (pairwise, within studies) using a computational model to determine whether differences were due to internal noise or the low level gain properties of contrast transduction. Taken together, the evidence points to differences in contrast gain as being responsible for the majority of individual variation across the normal population. This result is compared with related findings in attention and amblyopia. © 2013 Daniel H.},

Literature was sourced from peer-reviewed journals published over the last two decades which best represent research conducted in these areas. Findings show substantial evidence for atypical processing of auditory information in ASD at behavioural and neural levels. Abnormalities are diverse, ranging from atypical perception of various low-level perceptual features (i.e. pitch, loudness) to processing of more complex auditory information such as prosody. Trends across studies suggest auditory processing impairments in ASD are most likely to present during processing of complex auditory information and are more severe for speech than for non-speech stimuli.

However, odors are rarely encountered in isolation; thus, the brain must also separate distinct odor objects from complex and variable backgrounds. In vision, autistic traits are associated with superior performance in tasks that require focus on the local features of a perceptual scene. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the same advantage was observed in the analysis of olfactory scenes. To do this, we compared the ability of 1) 40 young adults (aged 16–35) with high (n = 20) and low levels of autistic traits and 2) 20 children (aged 7–11), with (n = 10) and without an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis, to identify individual odor objects presented within odor mixtures. First, we used a 4-alternative forced choice task to confirm that both adults and children were able to reliably identify 8 blended fragrances, representing food-related odors, when presented individually. We then used the same forced choice format to test participants’ ability to identify the odors when they were combined in either binary or ternary mixtures. Adults with high levels of autistic traits showed superior performance on binary but not ternary mixture trials, whereas children with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis outperformed age-matched neurotypical peers, irrespective of mixture complexity. These findings indicate that the local processing advantages associated with high levels of autistic traits in visual tasks are also apparent in a task requiring analytical processing of odor mixtures.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background: The Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) is a schedule for the diagnosis of autistic spectrum and related disorders and assessment of individual needs. It enables information to be recorded systematically for a wide range of behaviours and developmental skills and is suitable for use with all ages and levels of ability. In addition to helping the clinician to obtain a profile of each individual's pattern of development and behaviour, the DISCO also enables identification of specific features found in autistic spectrum disorders that are relevant for use with established diagnostic systems. Method: This paper describes the historical background of the DISCO, outlines its structure and reports the results of an inter-rater reliability study with parents of 82 children aged 3 to 11 years with autistic spectrum disorder, learning disability, language disorder or typical development. Results: Inter-rater reliability for the items in the interview was high (kappa coefficient or intra-class correlation at .75 or higher). This level of agreement was achieved for over 80\% of the interview items.},

In developing the research edition, items on the pilot version were reviewed for their internal consistency reliability, discriminant validity, and construct validity. Data from both samples on the research edition revealed high internal consistency reliability for domains and the total test and significant discrimination between the overresponsive and the typically responsive groups (p {\textless} .05). The preliminary psychometric integrity of the scales, along with continued research efforts, is an important contribution to evidence-based practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Unusual reactions to sensory stimuli are experienced by 90-95\% of people with an autism spectrum condition (ASC). Self-reported sensory reactivity in ASC has mainly been measured with generic questionnaires developed and validated on data from the general population. Interest in sensory reactivity in ASC increased after the inclusion of hyper- and hypo-reactivity together with unusual sensory interest as diagnostic markers of ASC in the DSM-5. Aims: To develop and pilot validate a self-report questionnaire designed from first-hand descriptions of the target group of adults diagnosed with high functioning ASC. Psychometric properties of the questionnaire were evaluated on a sample of participants with ASC diagnoses (N = 71) and a random sample from the general population (N = 162). Results: The Sensory Reactivity in Autism Spectrum (SR-AS is intended to be used as a screening tool in diagnostic processes with adults and for support in adapting compensating strategies and environmental adjustments. The internal consistency was high for both the SR-AS and its subscales. The total scale Cronbach's alpha was 0.96 and the subscales alphas were ≥ 0.80. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) showed best fit for a four-factor model of inter-correlated factors: hyper and hypo-reactivity, strong sensory interest and a sensory/motor factor. The questionnaire discriminated well between ASC-diagnosed participants and participants from the general population. Conclusions: The SR-AS displayed good internal consistency and discriminatory power and promising factorial validity.},

	abstract = {Sensory symptoms were recently added to the diagnostic criteria of autism spectrum disorder and may be a mechanism underlying the broad phenotype of autism spectrum disorder. To measure sensory symptoms based on perceptual rather than affective, regulative, or attention components, the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ) measuring five modalities of sensory sensitivity has been developed. In this study, the Dutch translation of the abridged SPQ-Short was investigated in a large sample of adults with (n = 657) and without autism spectrum disorder (n = 585). Its hypothesized factor structure, combining modality specific and one modality-independent factor, was assessed in a hierarchical model. Results show that modality-specific subscales are indeed present in the short version. Furthermore, its reliability is high and comparable to the original English version. The autism spectrum disorder group reported higher sensory sensitivities than the comparison group, and women with autism spectrum disorder reported higher sensitivities compared with men with autism spectrum disorder. The SPQ-Short correlates with all Autism Quotient (AQ)-Short subscales, except for the “imagination” subscale. The SPQ-Short seems suitable to further explore the relationship between basic sensory sensitivities in autism spectrum disorder and their related symptoms such as over- and under-responsivity to sensory stimulation. Lay Abstract: Individuals on the autism spectrum often experience heightened or reduced sensory sensitivities. This feature was recently added to the diagnostic manual for autism (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5)). To measure sensory sensitivities, the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ) has been developed. In this study, we tested whether a Dutch translation of the abridged SPQ-Short yields similar results as the original English version. We also tested whether this questionnaire can measure modality specific sensitivities. To this end, 657 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 585 adults without an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis filled out the Dutch SPQ-Short. The Dutch questionnaire data were very similar to the original English version: adults with autism spectrum disorder were more sensitive compared with adults without autism spectrum disorder. Women with autism spectrum disorder are more sensitive compared with men with autism spectrum disorder. Gender did not have an effect in the group without autism spectrum disorder. Individuals reporting higher sensory sensitivities also reported more autistic traits (such as lower social interests, or increased fascination for patterns). Finally, we found that the Dutch SPQ-Short is suited to measure modality-specific sensitivities. We conclude that the Dutch translation is a viable tool to measure sensory sensitivities in adults with and without autism spectrum disorder and can be used to further our understanding of differences in perception in people with or without autism spectrum disorder.},

The purpose of this study was to identify relationships in the 125 items of the revised Sensory Profile, a tool designed to assess children's responses to commonly occurring sensory events. Method. Parents of 1,115 children ages 3 to 10 years and without disabilities completed the Sensory Profilé. The parents reported the percentage of time their children engaged in each of the 125 behaviors listed on the profile. Results. Factor analysis revealed nine discreet factors that indicate sensory modulation and responsiveness: sensory seeking, emotionally reactive, low endurance/tone, oral sensory sensitivity, inattention/distractibility, poor registration, sensory sensitivity, sedentary, and fine motor/perceptual. Conclusions. In addition to the traditional method of organizing sensory history information by sensory system, we may need to consider a person's thresholds to sensory events as well as his or her responsiveness to sensation. Because the Sensory Profile factors in these children without disabilities are similar to patterns observed in children with various disabilities, it may be that some sensory processing problems are related to intensity or duration of behaviors as they begin to interfere with functional performance in daily life.},

	abstract = {Objective Sensory processing refers to reception, adjustment, and integration of sensory information se-quentially and generates adaptive responses. People need to have appropriate sensory processing abilities for functioning adequately in the environment and be able to participate in activities of daily living. Dunn's sensory processing model consists of two constructions. The first construction involves neurological thresh-olds, and the second construction concerns self-regulation. When the two continuums are connected, four basic patterns of sensory processing appear. The four models are: sensation seeking (including representa-tion of high thresholds and active self-regulation strategy), sensory avoiding (including representation of low thresholds and active self-regulation strategy), sensory sensitivity (including representation of low thresholds and passive self-regulation strategy), and low registration (including representation of high thresholds and passive self-regulation strategy). Sensory processing patterns can be seen in each age group from infancy to adulthood. These patterns are different for people with disabilities such as autism, attention deficit disorder/ hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, Asperger syndrome, developmental disorders, and learning disabilities compared to those without disability. Dunn sensory profile school companion is provided to assess sensory processing patterns in children. As sensory processing plays an important role in the daily life of people, the purpose of this study was to determine the validity and reliability of Dunn's sensory profile school companion in children and students in the age group of 3-11 years. Materials \& Methods The study was a descriptive-analytical one. The population consisted of all children and students aged between 3 and 11 years and studying in Tehran schools in the academic year 94-95 and those who attended preschools. The sample consisted of 384 children and students who were selected through multi-stage cluster sampling. Dunn's sensory profile companion was used to collect data. Dunn's sensory profile companion is a standardized measurement tool for assessing sensory processing abilities of children and students in the classroom and school and preschool environment. This tool was built by Winne Dunn. This profile are using for age range from 3 years to 11 years and 11 months and be completed by teachers and educators. Descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation were used for data analysis and confirmatory factor analysis, and Cronbach's alpha was used to draw inferences from the data. Results Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the validity of the sensory processing pro-file school companion. The results showed that sensory processing profiles are school companion and four factors had construct validity (P{\textless}0.001). Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was used to evalu-ate the reliability. Cronbach's alpha for the entire questionnaire was 0.879, and for sensory registration, sensation seeking sensory sensitivity and sensory avoiding was 0.818, 0.885, 0.825, 0.812 respectively. Thus, this confirms that the sensory processing profile school companion and four factors are reliable. Conclusion The results showed that Dunn's sensory profile has good reliability and validity. Dunn's sensory profile is a useful tool for assessing sensory processing patterns in school and kindergarten settings, and can be used by occupational therapists in clinical environments and by psychologists in educational environments. Information obtained from this profile can have diagnostic value and could also be used for the design of cur-riculum and classroom space.

	abstract = {Occupational therapists often use the Sensory Profile and the Sensory Processing Measure to assess the sensory needs of children. Therefore, it is important that the sensory processing scales that therapists use are reliable. The Sensory Processing Measure is a relatively new instrument, published in 2007, whereas the Sensory Profile appeared in 1999. The aim of the study was to investigate the reliability (internal consistency and inter-rater reliability) of the Sensory Profile, the Sensory Profile School Companion (SPSC), and the Home and Main Classroom Forms of the Sensory Processing Measure (SPM) in a cross-cultural setting. Parent participants (30 mothers and 30 fathers) each completed the Sensory Profile and the SPM-Home Form on the same child at ages between 5 and 10 years. Nineteen main classroom teachers of the same children then completed the SPSC and the SPM-Main Classroom Form. The internal consistency Cronbach alpha coefficients for the overall Sensory Profile, SPSC, SPM-Home Form, and SPM-Main Classroom Form were 0.97, 0.94, 0.93, and 0.86 respectively. The inter-rater reliability intra-class correlation coefficients for the overall Sensory Profile and SPM-Home Form were 0.48 (p=.48) and 0.63 (p=.005). Overall, the Sensory Profile and the SPM were found to have adequate levels of internal consistency. The Sensory Profile and SPM-Home Form exhibited moderate levels of inter-rater reliability. This study contributes to the evidence base and body of knowledge regarding internal consistency and inter-rater reliability, which previously consisted of the few studies reported in the respective Sensory Profile and SPM test manuals. This study also demonstrates that the Sensory Profile and SPM are reliable when used in a cross-cultural context. © Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

This study examined the development of sensory symptoms and the relationship between sensory symptoms and adaptive functioning during early childhood. Three groups of children were followed across three time points from 2 to 8 years of age: autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay, and typical development. At each time point, parents filled out questionnaires regarding their child's sensory symptoms and adaptive functioning. At the initial time point, parents of children with autism spectrum disorder reported more sensory symptoms in their children than parents in the typical development group. Parents in the autism spectrum disorder group reported more sensory symptoms than parents in the developmental delay group within smell, taste, and auditory domains. While the typical development group decreased in reported sensory symptoms across the study period, the clinical groups demonstrated no significant change across assessment points. Sensory symptoms for all groups were not independently predictive of adaptive functioning when verbal mental age was also included in the model. The young age range at the initial assessment and pattern of results suggest that sensory symptoms are present early in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disorders and remain stable over time.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE More than half of youth with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have sensory overresponsivity (SOR), an extreme negative reaction to sensory stimuli. However, little is known about the neurobiological basis of SOR, and there are few effective treatments. Understanding whether SOR is due to an initial heightened sensory response or to deficits in regulating emotional reactions to stimuli has important implications for intervention. OBJECTIVE To determine differences in brain responses, habituation, and connectivity during exposure to mildly aversive sensory stimuli in youth with ASDs and SOR compared with youth with ASDs without SOR and compared with typically developing control subjects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Functional magnetic resonance imagingwas used to examine brain responses and habituation to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 19 high-functioning youths with ASDs and 19 age- and IQ-matched, typically developing youths (age range, 9-17 years). Brain activity was related to parents' ratings of children's SOR symptoms. Functional connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex was compared between ASDs subgroups with and without SOR and typically developing controls without SOR. The study dates were March 2012 through February 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Relative increases in blood oxygen level-dependent signal response across the whole brain and within the amygdala during exposure to sensory stimuli compared with fixation, as well as correlation between blood oxygen level-dependent signal change in the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. RESULTS The mean age in both groups was 14 years and the majority in both groups (16 of 19 each) were male. Compared with neurotypical control participants, participants with ASDs displayed stronger activation in primary sensory cortices and the amygdala (P {\textless} .05, corrected). This activity was positively correlated with SOR symptoms after controlling for anxiety. The ASDs with SOR subgroup had decreased neural habituation to stimuli in sensory cortices and the amygdala compared with groups without SOR. Youth with ASDs without SOR showed a pattern of amygdala downregulation, with negative connectivity between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (thresholded at z {\textgreater} 1.70, P {\textless} .05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results demonstrate that youth with ASDs and SOR show sensorilimbic hyperresponsivity to mildly aversive tactile and auditory stimuli, particularly to multiple modalities presented simultaneously, and show that this hyperresponsivity is due to failure to habituate. In addition, findings suggest that a subset of youth with ASDs can regulate their responses through prefrontal downregulation of amygdala activity. Implications for intervention include minimizing exposure to multiple sensory modalities and building coping strategies for regulating emotional response to stimuli.},

Method: Using functional MRI, the authors measured change over time in activation of the amygdala and fusiform gyrus to neutral facial stimuli in adults with autism spectrum disorders and healthy comparison adults. Results: The comparison group evidenced significantly greater amygdala habituation bilaterally than the autism spectrum group. There were no group differences in overall fusiform habituation. For the autism spectrum group, lower levels of habituation of the amygdala to the face stimuli were associated with more severe social impairment. Conclusions: These resul ts suggest amygdala hyperarousal in autism spectrum disorders in response to socially relevant stimuli. Further, sustained amygdala arousal may contribute to the social deficits observed in autism spectrum disorders.},

People with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) are often over- or under-reactive to stimulation, leading to a wide range of behavioral symptoms. This altered sensitivity may be caused by disrupted sensory processing, signal integration and/or gating, and is often being neglected. Here, we review translational experimental approaches that are used to investigate sensory processing in humans with ASD and FXS, and in relevant rodent models. This includes electroencephalographic measurement of event related potentials, neural oscillations and mismatch negativity, as well as habituation and pre-pulse inhibition of startle. We outline robust evidence of disrupted sensory processing in individuals with ASD and FXS, and in respective animal models, focusing on the auditory sensory domain.

We collected ERP responses to a familiar repeated face (Familiar), an unfamiliar repeated face (Other) and novel faces (Novels) in 29 high-functioning adults with ASD and matched controls. For both groups, the P2 and N250 were sensitive to repetition (Other vs. Novels) and personal familiarity (Familiar vs. Other), and the face-N400 was sensitive to repetition. Adults with ASD did not show significantly atypical processing of facial familiarity and repetition in an ERP paradigm, despite showing significantly poorer performance than controls on a behavioral test of face memory.

We investigated habituation to repeated sounds using an oddball paradigm in 9-month-old infants with an older sibling with autism and hence at high risk for developing autism. Auditory-evoked responses to repeated sounds in control infants (at low risk of developing autism) decreased over time, demonstrating habituation, and their responses to deviant sounds were larger than responses to standard sounds, indicating discrimination. In contrast, neural responses in infants at high risk showed less habituation and a reduced sensitivity to changes in frequency. Reduced sensory habituation may be present at a younger age than the emergence of autistic behaviour in some individuals, and we propose that this could play a role in the over responsiveness to some stimuli and undersensitivity to others observed in autism. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health {\textbar} Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins.},

Here, I propose that this fundamental but unexplained phenomenon substantially derives from the ability of any pattern of neural excitation to create an enhanced inhibitory (or "negative") image of itself through target-specific scaling of inhibitory inputs onto active excitatory neurons. Familiar stimuli encounter strong negative images and are therefore less likely to be transmitted to higher brain centers. Integrating historical and recent observations, the negative-image model described here provides a mechanistic framework for understanding habituation, which is connected to ideas on dynamic predictive coding. In addition, it suggests insights for understanding autism spectrum disorders. Video Abstract: Neural mechanisms to filter predicted or irrelevant stimuli are essential for normal cognitive function.

We made substantial changes to only a few of the characteristics, usually to add new information and expand upon the description rather than to substantially alter the original point.

Examples are cited of persons with specific brain injury for the study of autism and the implications of a processing imbalance within a sequential framework are addressed by examining the development and behaviors of nonautistic persons who are also considered atypical. The chapter focuses on perceptually oriented behaviors that are characteristic of certain nonautistic persons that may be implicated in autistic symptomatology. Patterns of perceptual processing among persons with savant syndromes, blindness, visual agnosia, and frontotemporal dementia are examined as models of a vertical imbalance that may be a source of enhanced abilities in general, and among persons with autism in particular. Three strategies are highlighted that the authors consider to be helpful in better understanding aspects of cognitive enhancement among persons with autism: (1) neurological systems as loci of enhanced performance in cognition; (2) the relation between cognitive impairments and examples of enhanced performance; and (3) a developmental framework for speculating about possible origins of enhanced perceptual functioning.},

We suggest that the key notion of reduced global integration of information, which Frith proposed to underlie the assets in local processing, has been neglected in recent accounts of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In fact, most paradigms used to test weak coherence conflate global and local processing, often placing them in direct trade-off, so that it is not possible to tell whether patterns of performance in ASD reflect reduced global processing, increased local processing, or both. We review the literature from typical development and ASD that may be pertinent to this distinction and examine some data from our own studies. Only once tasks are devised that measure separately the effects of reduced global processing and increased local processing will it be possible to test the on-line and developmental relations between these two aspects of "weak coherence".

It cannot, however, explain either the non-triad features of autism, or earlier experimental findings of abnormal assets and deficits on non-social tasks. These unexplained aspects of autism, and the existence of autistic individuals who consistently pass false belief tasks, suggest that it may be necessary to postulate an additional cognitive abnormality. One possible abnormality - weak central coherence - is discussed, and preliminary evidence for this theory is presented. © 1994.},

In the first two experiments subjects were asked to respond to an auditorily presented name of a letter while looking at a visual stimulus that consisted of a large character (the global level) made out of small characters (the local level). The subjects' auditory discrimination responses were subject to interference only by the global level and not by the local one. In Experiment 3 subjects were presented with large characters made out of small ones, and they had to recognize either just the large characters or just the small ones. Whereas the identity of the small characters had no effect on recognition of the large ones, global cues which conflicted with the local ones did inhibit the responses to the local level. In Experiment 4 subjects were asked to judge whether pairs of simple patterns of geometrical forms which were presented for a brief duration were the same or different. The patterns within a pair could differ either at the global or at the local level. It was found that global differences were detected more often than local differences. © 1977.},

It concluded that further progress requires a reconsideration of the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the Gestalt approach, which is provided here. In particular, we review contemporary formulations of holism within an information-processing framework, allowing for operational definitions (e.g., integral dimensions, emergent features, configural superiority, global precedence, primacy of holistic/configural properties) and a refined understanding of its psychological implications (e.g., at the level of attention, perception, and decision). We also review 4 lines of theoretical progress regarding the law of Prägnanz-the brain's tendency of being attracted towards states corresponding to the simplest possible organization, given the available stimulation. The first considers the brain as a complex adaptive system and explains how self-organization solves the conundrum of trading between robustness and flexibility of perceptual states. The second specifies the economy principle in terms of optimization of neural resources, showing that elementary sensors working independently to minimize uncertainty can respond optimally at the system level. The third considers how Gestalt percepts (e.g., groups, objects) are optimal given the available stimulation, with optimality specified in Bayesian terms. Fourth, structural information theory explains how a Gestaltist visual system that focuses on internal coding efficiency yields external veridicality as a side effect. To answer the fundamental question of why things look as they do, a further synthesis of these complementary perspectives is required. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

Because of its continued relevance in modern psychology, this centennial anniversary is an excellent opportunity to take stock of what Gestalt psychology has offered and how it has changed since its inception. We first introduce the key findings and ideas in the Berlin school of Gestalt psychology, and then briefly sketch its development, rise, and fall. Next, we discuss its empirical and conceptual problems, and indicate how they are addressed in contemporary research on perceptual grouping and figure-ground organization. In particular, we review the principles of grouping, both classical (e.g., proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, parallelism) and new (e.g., synchrony, common region, element and uniform connectedness), and their role in contour integration and completion. We then review classic and new image-based principles of figure-ground organization, how it is influenced by past experience and attention, and how it relates to shape and depth perception. After an integrated review of the neural mechanisms involved in contour grouping, border ownership, and figure-ground perception, we conclude by evaluating what modern vision science has offered compared to traditional Gestalt psychology, whether we can speak of a Gestalt revival, and where the remaining limitations and challenges lie. A better integration of this research tradition with the rest of vision science requires further progress regarding the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the Gestalt approach, which is the focus of a second review article. © 2012 American Psychological Association.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neuropsychiatric condition traditionally defined by core symptoms in social behavior, speech/communication, repetitive behavior, and restricted interests. Beyond the core symptoms, autism has strong association with other disorders such as intellectual disability (ID), epilepsy, schizophrenia among many others. This paper outlines a theory of ASD with capacity to connect heterogeneous “core” symptoms, medical and psychiatric comorbidities as well as other etiological theories of autism in a unifying cognitive framework rooted in neuroscience and genetics. Cognition is embedded into an ever-developing structure modified by experiences, including the outcomes of environment influencing behaviors. The key constraint of cognition is that the brain can handle only 7±2 relevant variables at a time, whereas sensory variables, i.e., the number of sensory neurons is orders of magnitude larger. As a result, (a) the extraction, (b) the encoding, and (c) the capability for the efficient cognitive manipulation of the relevant variables, and (d) the compensatory mechanisms that counteract computational delays of the distributed components are critical. We outline our theoretical model to describe a Cartesian Factor (CF) forming, autoencoder-like cognitive mechanism which breaks combinatorial explosion and is accelerated by internal reinforcing machineries and discuss the neural processes that support CF formation. Impairments in any of these aspects may disrupt learning, cognitive manipulation, decisions on interactions, and execution of decisions. We suggest that social interactions are the most susceptible to combinations of diverse small impairments and can be spoiled in many ways that pile up. Comorbidity is experienced, if any of the many potential impairments is relatively strong. We consider component spoiling impairments as the basic colors of autism, whereas the combinations of individual impairments make the palette of autism. We put forth arguments on the possibility of dissociating the different main elements of the impairments that can appear together. For example, impairments of generalization (domain general learning) and impairments of dealing with many variable problems, such as social situations may appear independently and may mutually enhance their impacts. We also consider mechanisms that may lead to protection.},

	abstract = {Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder often co-occur. Among these, sensory impairment, which is a core diagnostic feature of autism spectrum disorder, is often observed in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. However, the underlying mechanisms of symptoms that are shared across disorders remain unknown. To examine the neural correlates of sensory symptoms that are associated with autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we analysed resting-state functional MRI data obtained from 113 people with either autism spectrum disorder or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 78 autism spectrum disorder, mean age = 29.5; n = 35 attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, mean age = 31.2) and 96 neurotypical controls (mean age = 30.6, range: 20–55 years) using a cross-sectional study design. First, we used a multi-dimensional approach to examine intrinsic brain functional connectivity related to sensory symptoms in four domains (i.e. low registration, sensation seeking, sensory sensitivity and sensation avoidance), after controlling for age, handedness and head motion. Then, we used a partial least squares correlation to examine the link between sensory symptoms related to intrinsic brain functional connectivity and neurodevelopmental symptoms measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Conners’ Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale, regardless of diagnosis. To test whether observed associations were specific to sensory symptoms related to intrinsic brain functional connectivity, we conducted a control analysis using a bootstrap framework. The results indicated that transdiagnostic yet distinct intrinsic brain functional connectivity neural bases varied according to the domain of the examined sensory symptom. Partial least squares correlation analysis revealed two latent components (latent component 1: q {\textless} 0.001 and latent component 2: q {\textless} 0.001). For latent component 1, a set of intrinsic brain functional connectivity was predominantly associated with neurodevelopmental symptom-related composite score (r = 0.64, P {\textless} 0.001), which was significantly correlated with Conners’ Adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale total T scores (r = −0.99, q {\textless} 0.001). For latent component 2, another set of intrinsic brain functional connectivity was positively associated with neurodevelopmental symptom-related composite score (r = 0.58, P {\textless} 0.001), which was eventually positively associated with Autism Spectrum Quotient total scores (r = 0.92, q {\textless} 0.001). The bootstrap analysis showed that the relationship between intrinsic brain functional connectivity and neurodevelopmental symptoms was relative to sensory symptom-related intrinsic brain functional connectivity (latent component 1: P = 0.003 and latent component 2: P {\textless} 0.001). The current results suggest that sensory symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder and those with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder have shared neural correlates. The neural correlates of the sensory symptoms were associated with the severity of both autism spectrum disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, regardless of diagnosis.},

Our data show that the ASD children have significantly reduced habituation relative to the NT children for both auditory and visual stimuli. These results point to impaired habituation as a modality-general phenomenon in ASD. Additionally, the rates of habituation are correlated with several clinical scores associated with competence along diverse phenotypic dimensions.

Research findings vary in indicating a local processing bias or a global processing deficit, and often contradict each other. We have applied a formal meta-analytic approach and combined 56 articles that tested about 1,000 ASD participants and used a wide range of stimuli and tasks to investigate local and global visual processing in ASD. Overall, results show no enhanced local visual processing nor a deficit in global visual processing. Detailed analysis reveals a difference in the temporal pattern of the local- global balance, that is, slow global processing in individuals with ASD.

	abstract = {In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of group design studies of nonpharmacological early interventions designed for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), we report summary effects across 7 early intervention types (behavioral, developmental, naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention [NDBI], TEACCH, sensory-based, animal-assisted, and technology-based), and 15 outcome categories indexing core and related ASD symptoms. A total of 1,615 effect sizes were gathered from 130 independent participant samples. A total of 6,240 participants, who ranged in age from 0-8 years, are represented across the studies. We synthesized effects within intervention and outcome type using a robust variance estimation approach to account for the nesting of effect sizes within studies. We also tracked study quality indicators, and report an additional set of summary effect sizes that restrict included studies to those meeting prespecified quality indicators. Finally, we conducted moderator analyses to evaluate whether summary effects across intervention types were larger for proximal as compared with distal effects, and for context-bound as compared to generalized effects. We found that when study quality indicators were not taken into account, significant positive effects were found for behavioral, developmental, and NDBI intervention types. When effect size estimation was limited to studies with randomized controlled trial (RCT) designs, evidence of positive summary effects existed only for developmental and NDBI intervention types. This was also the case when outcomes measured by parent report were excluded. Finally, when effect estimation was limited to RCT designs and to outcomes for which there was no risk of detection bias, no intervention types showed significant effects on any outcome.},

The report which followed Jennings (2000; Behavioural optometry - a critical review. Optom. Pract. 1: 67) concluded that there was a lack of controlled clinical trials to support behavioural management strategies. The purpose of this report was to evaluate the evidence in support of behavioural approaches as it stands in 2008. The available evidence was reviewed under 10 headings, selected because they represent patient groups/conditions that behavioural optometrists are treating, or because they represent approaches to treatment that have been advocated in the behavioural literature. The headings selected were: (1) vision therapy for accommodation/vergence disorders; (2) the underachieving child; (3) prisms for near binocular disorders and for producing postural change; (4) near point stress and low-plus prescriptions; (5) use of low-plus lenses at near to slow the progression of myopia; (6) therapy to reduce myopia; (7) behavioural approaches to the treatment of strabismus and amblyopia; (8) training central and peripheral awareness and syntonics; (9) sports vision therapy; (10) neurological disorders and neuro-rehabilitation after trauma/stroke. There is a continued paucity of controlled trials in the literature to support behavioural optometry approaches. Although there are areas where the available evidence is consistent with claims made by behavioural optometrists (most notably in relation to the treatment of convergence insufficiency, the use of yoked prisms in neurological patients, and in vision rehabilitation after brain disease/injury), a large majority of behavioural management approaches are not evidence-based, and thus cannot be advocated. © 2009 The Author.},

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are often accompanied by atypical visual, auditory, and tactile sensory behavior. Evidence also suggests alterations of the olfactory system, but the pattern of findings appears mixed. To quantify this pattern systematically, we conducted a meta-analysis. Studies were included if they examined olfactory function (i.e., odor threshold, or odor identification) in ASD compared with healthy age-matched control groups. We also coded for the potential moderators gender, age, and IQ. Articles were identified through computerized literature search using Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases. A total of 11 articles compared odor threshold and/or odor identification between cases and controls (for threshold, n = 143 ASD and 148 controls; and for identification, n = 132 ASD and 139 controls). Effects sizes showed a substantial heterogeneity. As a result, the 95\% prediction intervals were wide and ranged between a large negative and a large positive effect size for odor threshold, [-1.86, 2.05], and for odor identification, [-1.51, 2.52]. Exploratory analyses suggested that age and IQ may be potential moderators. To conclude, the large heterogeneity is consistent with the notion of both hyposensitivity and hypersensitivity in individuals with ASD. However, future research needs to predict and test the specific direction of the effect to provide convincing evidence for atypical olfactory functions in ASD.},

	abstract = {Background: Previous research using the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ) has reported greater sensory hypersensitivity in people with autism spectrum condition (ASC) compared to controls, consistent with other research. However, current scoring of the SPQ does not differentiate between hyper and hyposensitivity, making it uncertain whether individuals with ASC might also show differences in hyposensitivity. Furthermore, no research to date has focused on sensory differences in females, and whether differences in sensory sensitivity extend to the broader autism phenotype (BAP). The present study aimed to fill these gaps. Methods: The present study developed and validated a Revised Scoring of the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ-RS) in order to investigate self-reported hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity in three groups of adults: A female ASC group (n = 152), mothers of children with ASC (BAP mothers group; n = 103), and a control mothers group (n = 74). All participants completed the SPQ as a self-report measure of sensory processing and the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ) as a measure of the degree of autism traits. Results: The female ASC group reported significantly more hypersensitivity, but not more hyposensitivity, compared to the control female and BAP mothers groups. The BAP mothers group did not differ from the control mothers group in either reported hypersensitivity (p =.365) or hyposensitivity (p =.075), suggesting atypical sensory sensitivity is not a BAP trait within females. SPQ-RS hypersensitivity scores positively correlated with autistic traits in the female ASC (r =.266) and BAP mothers groups (r =.350). Conclusions: The present findings revealed greater sensory hypersensitivity, but not hyposensitivity, in females with ASC compared to BAP and control female groups, and that a greater degree of autism traits relates to higher hypersensitivity in ASC females. The results offer support for the enhanced perceptual functioning model using large samples of females, who are an understudied population, and demonstrate the validity of the SPQ-RS as a valuable new research tool for exploring self-reported hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity.},

	abstract = {The current diagnostic practices are linked to a 20-fold increase in the reported prevalence of ASD over the last 30 years. Fragmenting the autism phenotype into dimensional “autistic traits” results in the alleged recognition of autism-like symptoms in any psychiatric or neurodevelopemental condition and in individuals decreasingly distant from the typical population, and prematurely dismisses the relevance of a diagnostic threshold. Non-specific socio-communicative and repetitive DSM 5 criteria, combined with four quantitative specifiers as well as all their possible combinations, render limitless variety of presentations consistent with the categorical diagnosis of ASD. We propose several remedies to this problem: maintain a line of research on prototypical autism; limit the heterogeneity compatible with a categorical diagnosis to situations with a phenotypic overlap and a validated etiological link with prototypical autism; reintroduce the qualitative properties of autism presentations and of current dimensional specifiers, language, intelligence, comorbidity, and severity in the criteria used to diagnose autism in replacement of quantitative “social” and “repetitive” criteria; use these qualitative features combined with the clinical intuition of experts and machine-learning algorithms to differentiate coherent subgroups in today’s autism spectrum; study these subgroups separately, and then compare them; and question the autistic nature of “autistic traits”.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging studies have reported structural and physiological differences that could help understand the causes and development of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Many of them rely on multisite designs, with the recruitment of larger samples increasing statistical power. However, recent large-scale studies have put some findings into question, considering the results to be strongly dependent on the database used, and demonstrating the substantial heterogeneity within this clinically defined category. One major source of variance may be the acquisition of the data in multiple centres. In this work we analysed the differences found in the multisite, multi-modal neuroimaging database from the UK Medical Research Council Autism Imaging Multicentre Study (MRC AIMS) in terms of both diagnosis and acquisition sites. Since the dissimilarities between sites were higher than between diagnostic groups, we developed a technique called Significance Weighted Principal Component Analysis (SWPCA) to reduce the undesired intensity variance due to acquisition site and to increase the statistical power in detecting group differences. After eliminating site-related variance, statistically significant group differences were found, including Broca's area and the temporo-parietal junction. However, discriminative power was not sufficient to classify diagnostic groups, yielding accuracies results close to random. Our work supports recent claims that ASD is a highly heterogeneous condition that is difficult to globally characterize by neuroimaging, and therefore different (and more homogenous) subgroups should be defined to obtain a deeper understanding of ASD.

Our review of the literature has revealed both historical and recent references to and research about sensory and movement difference characteristics and symptoms for individuals with autism. What is notably infrequent in this literature, however, is research that highlights the perspective of the individual with autism. If we wish to truly understand the experience of sensory and movement differences for individuals with autism, we must explore their experiences and perspectives. This study presents a qualitative analysis of more than 40 h in-depth inquiry into the lives of five individuals with the autism label. Data were sorted into six categories: perception, action, posture, emotion, communication, and cognition. The insights into sensory and movement differences and autism offered by these individuals was illuminating. We found that the data strongly supported the presence of disruption of organization and regulation of sensory and movement differences in the lived experience of these participants with autism. The present data suggests that in autism this disruption of organization and regulation is amplified in terms of quantity, quality, intensity, and may affect everyday life. These data contribute to a more expansive view of autism that incorporates the possibility that autism is a disorder that affects motor planning, behavior, communication, the sensory motor system, and the dynamic interaction of all of these. © 2012 Robledo, Donnellan and Strandt-Conroy.},

The key inclusion criteria were that the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based instruction. Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies. Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies, elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between number of treatment sessions learning gains for games. With regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of considering instructional design principles when designing virtual reality-based instruction.},

	abstract = {Background: Virtual reality (VR) is an innovation that permits the individual to discover and operate within threedimensional (3D) environment to gain practical understanding. This research aimed to examine the general efficiency of VR for teaching medical anatomy.
Methods: We executed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies of the performance of VR anatomy education. We browsed five databases from the year 1990 to 2019. Ultimately, 15 randomized controlled trials with a teaching outcome measure analysis were included. Two authors separately chose studies, extracted information, and examined the risk of bias. The primary outcomes were examination scores of the students. Secondary outcomes were the degrees of satisfaction of the students. Random-effects models were used for the pooled evaluations of scores and satisfaction degrees. Standardized mean difference (SMD) was applied to assess the systematic results. The heterogeneity was determined by I2 statistics, and then was investigated by meta-regression and subgroup analyses.
Results: In this review, we screened and included fifteen randomized controlled researches (816 students). The pooled analysis of primary outcomes showed that VR improves test scores moderately compared with other approaches (standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.53; 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.09–0.97, p {\textless} 0.05; I2 = 87.8\%). The high homogeneity indicated that the studies were different from each other. Therefore, we carried out metaregression as well as subgroup analyses using seven variables (year, country, learners, course, intervention, comparator, and duration). We found that VR improves post-intervention test score of anatomy compared with other types of teaching methods.
Conclusions: The finding confirms that VR may act as an efficient way to improve the learners’ level of anatomy knowledge. Future research should assess other factors like degree of satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and adverse reactions when evaluating the teaching effectiveness of VR in anatomy.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, virtual reality (VR) has re-emerged as a popular technology trend. This is mainly due to the recent investments from technology companies that are improving VR systems while increasing consumer access and interest. Amongst many applications of VR, one area that is particularly promising is for pedagogy. The immersive, experiential learning offered by VR provides new training and learning opportunities driven by the latest versions of affordable, highly immersive and easy to use head mounted display (HMD) systems. VR has been tested as a tool for training across diverse settings with varying levels of success in the past. However, there is a lack of recent review studies that investigates the effectiveness, advantages, limitations, and feasibility of using VR HMDs in training. This review aims to investigate the extent to which VR applications are useful in training, specifically for professional skill and safety training contexts. In this paper, we present the results from a systematic review of the effectiveness of VR-based simulation training from the past 30 years. As a secondary aim, the methodological trends of application and practical challenges of implementing VR in training curriculum were also assessed. The results suggest that there is generally high acceptance amongst trainees for VR-based training regardless of the technology limitations, usability challenges and cybersickness. There is evidence that VR is useful for training cognitive skills, such as spatial memory, learning and remembering procedures and psychomotor skills. VR is also found to be a good alternative where on the job training is either impossible or unsafe to implement. However, many training effectiveness studies reviewed lack experimental robustness due to limited study participants and questionable assessment methods. These results map out the current known strengths and weaknesses of VR HMDs and provide insight into required future research areas as the new era of VR HMD’s evolve.},

	abstract = {The increasing popularity of Virtual Reality (VR) has provoked scholars’ and educators’ interest to explore its potential as a learning environment for various fields of education. Along this line, several literature reviews have analysed and synthesised the educational use of VR; however, scholar activity is lacking a recent review of VR on a specific field of interest such as language learning. Thus this paper delineates the contour of scholarly literature on VR as an emerging technology in language teaching and learning. Using 17 high-impact journals and conferences in the fields of Computer-Assisted Language Learning and Educational Technology as a source, 26 scholarly manuscripts were retrieved from 2015 to 2018, analysed and synthesised under the following foci: (a) technologies used, language learning settings and duration of educational activities; (b) benefits and limitations from using VR as an educational tool in the language classroom; (c) future research directions regarding the educational use of VR based on the reviewed literature. This paper argues that VR is an invaluable tool in the language classrooms but entails challenges regarding its technical configuration, as well as its pedagogical grounding. The study concludes with some discussion and implications for researchers and practitioners.},

	abstract = {Elementary school remedial teaching has been promoted for many years in Taiwan but it has primarily been aimed at Chinese and mathematics with little attention being paid to natural sciences. Due to the current shortage of natural science teachers, along with limitations in school budget and manpower, it is difficult to put natural science remedial teaching into practice in elementary schools. This research attempts to establish a new model of remedial teaching that utilizes remote asynchronous video-based instruction to carry out centralized remedial teaching with 3D television and interactive response system. We focused on fourth graders whose science ranking was at the bottom quarter and examined if their grades have improved. Centralized remedial teaching was implemented once a week during school’s noon break and lasted for 40 minutes. The materials used, including the remedial 3D natural science lesson videos and interactive response test questions, were both produced by the university. They were transmitted through the Internet to elementary school teachers who played them on 3D television and students practiced and answered the questions in real time with plickers. Twenty fourth graders from different classes participated in remedial teaching for one semester; the average percentage of test grade ranking in natural science has progressed from 9.19\% to 24.12\% in their original classes. Previously, the average of T-score in natural science test was 35.80, and after remedial instruction, the T-score average was 42.39. The T-score average improvement is statistically significant (t=3.34, p = .003). The research revealed that this instructional model can improve learning outcome in natural science for underachieving fourth graders, and through the questionnaire, it was also known that the students liked this remedial teaching approach.},

In this paper, we present a study that compares the effectiveness of virtual training and physical training for teaching a bimanual assembly task. In a between-subjects experiment, 60 participants were trained to solve three 3D burr puzzles in one of six conditions comprised of virtual and physical training elements. In the four physical conditions, training was delivered via paper- and video-based instructions, with or without the physical puzzles to practice with. In the two virtual conditions, participants learnt to assemble the puzzles in an interactive virtual environment, with or without 3D animations showing the assembly process. After training, we conducted immediate tests in which participants were asked to solve a physical version of the puzzles. We measured performance through success rates and assembly completion testing times. We also measured training times as well as subjective ratings on several aspects of the experience. Our results show that the performance of virtually trained participants was promising. A statistically significant difference was not found between virtual training with animated instructions and the best performing physical condition (in which physical blocks were available during training) for the last and most complex puzzle in terms of success rates and testing times. Performance in retention tests two weeks after training was generally not as good as expected for all experimental conditions. We discuss the implications of the results and highlight the validity of virtual reality systems in training.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Surgical training methods are evolving with the technological advancements, including the application of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality. However, 28 to 40\% of novice residents are not confident in performing a major surgical procedure. VR surgery, an immersive VR (iVR) experience, was developed using Oculus Rift and Leap Motion devices (Leap Motion, Inc, San Francisco, CA) to address this challenge. Our iVR is a multisensory, holistic surgical training application that demonstrates a maxillofacial surgical technique, the Le Fort I osteotomy. The main objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of using VR surgery on the self-confidence and knowledge of surgical residents.
Materials and Methods
A multisite, single-blind, parallel, randomized controlled trial (RCT) was performed. The participants were novice surgical residents with limited experience in performing the Le Fort I osteotomy. The primary outcome measures were the self-assessment scores of trainee confidence using a Likert scale and an objective assessment of the cognitive skills. Ninety-five residents from 7 dental schools were included in the RCT. The participants were randomly divided into a study group of 51 residents and a control group of 44. Participants in the study group used the VR surgery application on an Oculus Rift with Leap Motion device. The control group participants used similar content in a standard PowerPoint presentation on a laptop. Repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was applied to the data to assess the overall effect of the intervention on the confidence of the residents.
Results
The study group participants showed significantly greater perceived self-confidence levels compared with those in the control group (P = .034; α = 0.05). Novices in the first year of their training showed the greatest improvement in their confidence compared with those in their second and third year.
Conclusions
iVR experiences improve the knowledge and self-confidence of the surgical residents.},

	abstract = {The increased availability and development of immersive technologies have given students growing opportunities to engage in different educational subjects. However, there is a lack of empirical research exploring the educational influence of using Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in science classrooms. To address this gap, this study developed a series of IVR-based science lessons for middle-school students and further examined these lessons’ effects on learning performance. Our quasi-experimental approach employed a pretest and posttest to measure academic achievement and questionnaires to measure engagement and technology acceptance. A total of 90 sixth-grade students from two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. The experimental group engaged with the science lessons using Head-Mounted Displays, whereas the control group learned the same material through traditional teaching methods. The results revealed that the experimental group obtained significantly higher academic achievement and engagement scores (cognitive, behavioral, emotional and social) than the control group. Moreover, the experimental group had a high level of technology acceptance for IVR usage in classrooms. Our study provides empirical evidence for IVR’s use in science education. Furthermore, it also sheds light on how to develop and implement an IVR-based classroom for formal educational purposes. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic? Virtual Reality (VR) technology has been applied to different educational subjects and there is some empirical evidence indicating its potential benefits for students’ learning. VR is considered to have potential for educational uses in classrooms. Many studies have applied non-immersive VR to science subjects, but few have focused on the use of Immersive VR (IVR) in everyday classrooms. What this paper adds We developed and implemented an IVR-based teaching platform containing a set of systematic science lessons that students can engage in with Head-Mounted Displays in classrooms. The results revealed that adopting IVR science lessons in the classroom can improve students’ academic achievement and engagement. Implications for practice and/or policy This study contributes to identifying the positive influences of an IVR-based classroom on students’ science academic achievement and engagement. The results provide practical insights into developing and implementing an IVR-based classroom for educational purposes. This study offers a concrete example of using IVR in middle-school classrooms for formal science education.},

	abstract = {Background Three-dimensional (3D) computer modeling and interactive virtual reality (VR) simulation are validated teaching techniques used throughout medical disciplines. Little objective data exists supporting its use in teaching clinical anatomy. Learner motivation is thought to limit the rate of utilization of such novel technologies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, satisfaction, and motivation associated with immersive VR simulation in teaching medical students neuroanatomy. Methods Images of normal cerebral anatomy were reconstructed from human Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) computed tomography (CT) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into 3D VR formats compatible with the Oculus Rift VR System, a head-mounted display with tracking capabilities allowing for an immersive VR experience. The ventricular system and cerebral vasculature were highlighted and labeled to create a focused interactive model. We conducted a randomized controlled study with 66 medical students (33 in both the control and experimental groups). Pertinent neuroanatomical structures were studied using either online textbooks or the VR interactive model, respectively. We then evaluated the students’ anatomy knowledge, educational experience, and motivation (using the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey [IMMS], a previously validated assessment). Results There was no significant difference in anatomy knowledge between the 2 groups on preintervention, postintervention, or retention quizzes. The VR group found the learning experience to be significantly more engaging, enjoyable, and useful (all p {\textless} 0.01) and scored significantly higher on the motivation assessment (p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusion Immersive VR educational tools awarded a more positive learner experience and enhanced student motivation. However, the technology was equally as effective as the traditional text books in teaching neuroanatomy.},

The aim of the current study was to investigate the direct and interactive association between commonly used indicators of SES and the exposure to stressful life situations in relation to children’s mental health problems. Methods The prospective BELLA cohort study is the mental health module of the representative, population-based German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for children and adolescents (KiGGS). Sample data include 2,111 participants (aged 7–17 years at baseline) from the first three measurement points (2003–2006, 2004–2007 and 2005–2008). Hierarchical multiple linear regression models were conducted to analyze associations among the SES indicators household income, parental education and parental unemployment (assessed at baseline), number of stressful life situations (e.g., parental accident, mental illness or severe financial crises; 1- and 2-year follow-ups) and parent-reported mental health problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; 2-year follow-up). Results All indicators of SES separately predicted mental health problems in children and adolescents at the 2-year follow-up. Stressful life situations (between baseline and 2-year follow-up) and the interaction of parental education and the number of stressful life situations remained significant in predicting children’s mental health problems after adjustment for control variables. Thereby, children with higher educated parents showed fewer mental health problems in a stressful life situation. No moderating effect was found for household income and parental employment. Overall, the detected effect sizes were small. Mental health problems at baseline were the best predictor for mental health problems two years later. Conclusions Children and adolescents with a low SES suffer from multiple stressful life situations and are exposed to a higher risk of developing mental health problems. The findings suggest that the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities and interventions for families with low parental education might help to reduce children’s mental health problems.},

	doi = {10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.0054},
	abstract = {Importance: The global prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been reported to be between 1\% and 2\% of the population, with little research in Black, Asian, and other racial/ethnic minority groups. Accurate estimates of ASD prevalence are vital to planning diagnostic, educational, health, and social care services and may detect possible access barriers to diagnostic pathways and services and inequalities based on social determinants of health.
Objective: To evaluate whether socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with ASD prevalence and the likelihood of accessing ASD services in racial/ethnic minority and disadvantaged groups in England.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control prevalence cohort study used the Spring School Census 2017 from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census of the National Pupil Database, which is a total population sample that includes all English children, adolescents, and young adults aged 2 to 21 years in state-funded education. Data were collected on January 17, 2017, and analyzed from August 2, 2018, to January 28, 2020.
Exposures: Age and sex were treated as a priori confounders while assessing correlates of ASD status according to (1) race/ethnicity, (2) social disadvantage, (3) first language spoken, (4) Education, Health and Care Plan or ASD Special Educational Needs and Disability support status, and (5) mediation analysis to assess how social disadvantage and language might affect ASD status.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Sex- and age-standardized ASD prevalence by race/ethnicity and 326 English local authority districts in pupils aged 5 to 19 years.
Results: The final population sample consisted of 7 047 238 pupils (50.99\% male; mean [SD] age, 10.18 [3.47] years) and included 119 821 pupils with ASD, of whom 21 660 also had learning difficulties (18.08\%). The standardized prevalence of ASD was 1.76\% (95\% CI, 1.75\%-1.77\%), with male pupils showing a prevalence of 2.81\% (95\% CI, 2.79\%-2.83\%) and female pupils a prevalence of 0.65\% (95\% CI, 0.64\%-0.66\%), for a male-to-female ratio (MFR) of 4.32:1. Standardized prevalence was highest in Black pupils (2.11\% [95\% CI, 2.06\%-2.16\%]; MFR, 4.68:1) and lowest in Roma/Irish Travelers (0.85\% [95\% CI, 0.67\%-1.03\%]; MFR, 2.84:1). Pupils with ASD were more likely to face social disadvantage (adjusted prevalence ratio, 1.61; 95\% CI, 1.59-1.63) and to speak English as an additional language (adjusted prevalence ratio, 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.63-0.65). The effect of race/ethnicity on ASD status was mediated mostly through social disadvantage, with Black pupils having the largest effect (standardized mediation coefficient, 0.018; P {\textless} .001) and 12.41\% of indirect effects through this way.
Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that significant differences in ASD prevalence exist across racial/ethnic groups and geographic areas and local authority districts, indicating possible differential phenotypic prevalence or differences in detection or referral for racial/ethnic minority groups.},

	abstract = {While flavours comprised of simple taste/odour combinations can be easily decomposed, there is evidence that the individual components are seldom perceived independently. Manifestations of interactions include smell/taste confusions, attribution of taste properties such as sweetness or sourness to odours, and the enhancement and suppression of tastes by such odours. These phenomena are probably the result of blurring of the perceptual boundaries of odour and taste properties during repeated pairings as flavours. Following such pairings in the laboratory, odours can be shown to increase in perceived taste properties. It is proposed that during flavour formation, the components are encoded in memory in such a way that a later odour stimulus also elicits taste properties. Sensory properties such as sweetness can thus be seen as cognitive phenomena associated with both tastes and odours, in the latter case residing in memory. However, unlike some odour combinations, flavours, although usually perceived as a functional whole, are not indivisible synthetic entities. Perceptual interactions between odours and tastes are dependent on the extent to which an analytical approach is taken to the measurement of flavour qualities. Thus, odour enhancement of sucrose sweetness is not observed when the intensities of all the components in a flavour are rated. This has been interpreted as a consequence of rating strategies. However, the data are more consistent with a perceptual/cognitive interpretation. Recent research from our lab has shown that the cognitive strategy employed during the pairing of odours and tastes will also determine whether taste/odour interactions occur. The question of how to measure flavour properties is raised by these findings. Whether panellists focus on the sensory source of, for example, sweetness will depend upon the perceptual strategy they adopt. Asking panellists to focus only on the taste sweetness, while possible, may be assuming that odour and taste properties are independent within foods. ©},

	abstract = {Perceptions of the flavors of foods or beverages reflect information derived from multiple sensory afferents, including gustatory, olfactory, and somatosensory fibers. Although flavor perception therefore arises from the central integration of multiple sensory inputs, it is possible to distinguish the different modalities contributing to flavor, especially when attention is drawn to particular sensory characteristics. Nevertheless, our experiences of the flavor of a food or beverage are also simultaneously of an overall unitary perception. Research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind this integrated flavor perception is, for the most part, relatively recent. However, psychophysical, neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies on cross-modal sensory interactions involved in flavor perception have started to provide an understanding of the integrated activity of sensory systems that generate such unitary perceptions, and hence the mechanisms by which these signals are “functionally united when anatomically separated”. Here we review this recent research on odor/taste integration, and propose a model of flavor processing that depends on prior experience with the particular combination of sensory inputs, temporal and spatial concurrence, and attentional allocation. We propose that flavor perception depends upon neural processes occurring in chemosensory regions of the brain, including the anterior insula, frontal operculum, orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as upon the interaction of this chemosensory “flavor network” with other heteromodal regions including the posterior parietal cortex and possibly the ventral lateral prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {Research into the representation and processing of conceptual knowledge has typically associated perceptual facts with sensory brain regions and executive retrieval mechanisms with the left prefrontal cortex. However, this dichotomy between knowledge content and retrieval processes leaves unanswered how the brain supports concepts less reliant on direct sensory experiences. We used neuroimaging methods to investigate whether an increased abstractness in semantic decisions, in contrast to increased response difficulty, is associated with increased left prefrontal activation. Participants were presented with concrete animal names and asked to verify sensory and abstract properties that corresponded only to the animal category. Candidate semantic regions were localized in left inferior, frontopolar, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in contrast to a pseudoword control. Activity in each of these prefrontal regions was associated with significantly increased activity for abstract relative to sensory semantic decisions, regardless of increased response difficulty and even when controlling for the response times of participants. These results suggest that more abstract, or verbally-mediated, semantic knowledge of concrete items, in contrast to more sensory-based properties, is specifically supported by the left prefrontal cortex. Semantic retrieval mechanisms may rely on abstract representations, likely coded through a verbal format, to mediate task demands when perceptual information is insufficient.},

	abstract = {Objective
To review the Dominic-R and the Terry questionnaires, respectively, for white and African-American children, both DSM-III-R-based, and more recent DSM-IV-based computerized versions.
Method
Five papers describing the development, content, validation studies, and establishment of the diagnostic cutpoints of these instruments are reviewed. The instruments are pictorial, fully structured, and designed to assess mental disorders in children 6 to 11 years of age. Symptom descriptions complement the visual stimulus, providing better information-processing than visual or auditory stimuli alone. Cognitive immaturity of young children bars frequency, duration, and age-of-onset measurements, restricting correspondence with DSM criteria. DSM-IV (computerized versions) and DSM-III-R (paper versions) disorders being assessed include specific (simple) phobias, separation anxiety, generalized anxiety (overanxious), depression/dysthymia, attention-deficit hyperactivity, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorder.
Results
Test-retest reliability of symptoms and symptom scores and criterion validity against clinical judgment support the visual-auditory combination of stimuli to assess child mental health.
Conclusion
Intended for clinical, epidemiological, and screening purposes, these instruments are short and simple. Although it only approximates DSM-III-R and DSM-IV criteria, the pictorial format permits young children to be reliable informants about their mental health.},

	abstract = {Purpose
In pediatric oncology, clear communication regarding symptom occurrence between clinicians and children is essential in order to provide safe and effective care. Mobile technology provides a means to enhance the standard clinician-patient interview, particularly among children, who are well versed in the use of technology. To help children identify and voice their concerns in the health care setting, researchers created Sisom, an animated computer tool for children and young people with serious and chronic illnesses. The purposes of this study of 100 dyads of patients 7–12 years of age and their parents were to: compare participants' reports of symptom occurrence using Sisom to a standard symptom checklist and determine the time requirements, ease of use, and perceived usefulness of the Sisom tool by children with cancer and their parents.
Methods
Child and parent participants completed both Sisom and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Symptoms on the two tools were compared and 20 items were similar to allow for comparisons.
Results
Children reported a significantly higher number of these 20 symptoms using Sisom as compared to the MSAS (i.e., 6.8 versus 4.9 symptoms, p {\textless} 0.001). A similar pattern was noted for parental proxy reports (i.e., 8.7 versus 5.7 symptoms, p {\textless} 0.001). Sisom was completed in less than 30 min, with high ratings of ease of use and perceived usefulness from parent participants.
Conclusions
Sisom provides a systematic and engaging method to elicit symptom reports from children for use in clinical care and research.},

	abstract = {The study of school bullying has recently assumed an international dimension, but is faced with difficulties in finding terms in different languages to correspond to the English word bullying. To investigate the meanings given to various terms, a set of 25 stick–figure cartoons was devised, covering a range of social situations between peers. These cartoons were shown to samples of 8– and 14–year–old pupils (N= 1,245; n= 604 at 8 years, n= 641 at 14 years) in schools in 14 different countries, who judged whether various native terms cognate to bullying, applied to them. Terms from 10 Indo–European languages and three Asian languages were sampled. Multidimensional scaling showed that 8–year–olds primarily discriminated nonaggressive and aggressive cartoon situations; however, 14–year–olds discriminated fighting from physical bullying, and also discriminated verbal bullying and social exclusion. Gender differences were less appreciable than age differences. Based on the 14–year–old data, profiles of 67 words were then constructed across the five major cartoon clusters. The main types of terms used fell into six groups: bullying (of all kinds), verbal plus physical bullying, solely verbal bullying, social exclusion, solely physical aggression, and mainly physical aggression. The findings are discussed in relation to developmental trends in how children understand bullying, the inferences that can be made from cross–national studies, and the design of such studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose. The effects of pictorial aids in medication instructions on medication recall, comprehension, and adherence are reviewed.Summary. Many patients depend on medication labels and patient information leaflets for pertinent drug information, but these materials are often difficult for patients to understand. Research in psychology and marketing indicates that humans have a cognitive preference for picture-based, rather than text-based, information. Studies have shown that pictorial aids improve recall, comprehension, and adherence and are particularly useful for conveying timing of doses, instructions on when to take medicine, and the importance of completing a course of therapy. Other research has compared various techniques for using picture-based information and supports the use of integrative instructions, a combination of textual, oral, and pictorial communication, to promote comprehension and adherence. While pictures have generally proven useful for improving patient comprehension and adherence, not all picture-based interventions have produced successful results. Some icons, particularly clock icons, have been found to be too complex to enhance understanding and could not overcome the advantage provided by the familiarity of the textbased format, suggesting that patients be trained to use pictorial medication information before they are expected to use icons as an aid for medication administration. In addition to enhancing understanding, pictorial aids have been found to improve patients’ satisfaction with medication instructions.Conclusion. The use of pictorial aids enhances patients’ understanding of how they should take their medications, particularly when pictures are used in combination with written or oral instructions.},

Despite this, current measures assessing sensory sensitivities do not appear to fully capture this, especially in children. This study aimed to adapt an adult measure of sensory sensitivities – the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire – for use with children aged between aged between 8 and 11. 234 children filled out this adaption while their caregivers completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient: Children’s Version. The results found that the two questionnaires had a significant but surprisingly small correlation. Future work should look at identifying the extent to which the Children’s Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is capturing greater sensory difficulties in non-autistic children or increased measurement error.},

	abstract = {Does the immersive design of an educational gaming environment affect learners’ virtual presence and how much do they learn? Does virtual presence affect learning? This study tries to answer these questions by examining the differences in virtual presence and learning outcomes in two different computer-based multimedia environments: a gaming environment with high immersive design vs. hypertext learning environment with low immersive design. As the main focus, the effect of virtual presence on learning is also explained and tested. By identifying virtual presence as a variable that may determine learning, it is argued that computer gaming environments present a new challenge for researchers to investigate, particularly, the effects of virtual presence on the immersive design of games in order to help designers to predict which instructional configurations will maximize learning performance. In general, results revealed that the high-immersive gaming environment leads to the strongest form of virtual presence but also decreased learning. Although regression analyses indicate that virtual presence positively influences trivial- and non-trivial learning outcomes, learners who learned in a low-immersive environment outperformed the gaming group. A mediation analysis showed that the relation between virtual presence and non-trivial learning outcomes is partly mediated through increased cognitive load.},

	doi = {10.1109/VR.2016.7504689},
	abstract = {The use of a self-avatar inside an immersive virtual reality system has been shown to have important effects on presence, interaction and perception of space. Based on studies from linguistics and cognition, in this paper we demonstrate that a self-avatar may aid the participant's cognitive processes while immersed in a virtual reality system. In our study participants were asked to memorise pairs of letters, perform a spatial rotation exercise and then recall the pairs of letters. In a between-subject factor they either had an avatar or not, and in a within-subject factor they were instructed to keep their hands still or not. We found that participants who both had an avatar and were allowed to move their hands had significantly higher letter pair recall. There was no significant difference between the other three conditions. Further analysis showed that participants who were allowed to move their hands, but could not see the self-avatar, usually didn't move their hands or stopped moving their hands after a short while. We argue that an active self-avatar may alleviate the mental load of doing the spatial rotation exercise and thus improve letter recall. The results are further evidence of the importance of an appropriate self-avatar representation in immersive virtual reality.},

	abstract = {Objective
The aim of this study is to assess whether distraction (lack of attentional focus) and attention (cognitive load) are differentially involved in the analgesic effect of virtual reality (VR) immersions during a cold pressor test (CPT).

Methods
Thirty-one participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions (high and low cognitive load, attention with or without a reminder of the pain stimuli) and performed three CPTs. Pain was assessed based on the duration of the CPT (pain tolerance), a visual analog rating scale of perceived pain intensity during the CPT and the subjective pain scale of the Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ).

Results
The statistical analyses revealed that VR immersions were associated with less pain compared to the baseline (all p {\textless}0.001), but for the experimental manipulations, only the conditions where there was an increase in cognitive load (ie, from low cognitive load at Immersion 1 to high cognitive load at Immersion 2) were effective for increasing pain tolerance (significant Time X Conditions interaction). The interactions were not significant for pain intensity assessed with the VAS or the SF-MPQ.

Conclusion
The results suggest that increases in cognitive load play an important role in the analgesic effect of VR immersion, although the combination of attentional focus and cognitive load may be important. Suggestions are given for designing a replication study.},

Virtual Reality (VR) has become a more available method of research in the last few decades. No 
previous research has investigated perceptual differences using this technology. The standard ROCF 
test was used as a baseline task to look at a practical aspect of using VR as an experimental platform. 
94 participants were tested. Attention-to-Detail, Attention Switching and Imagination subscales of AQ 
questionnaire were found to be predictors of organisational ROCF scores, whereas only Attention-to?Detail subscale was predictive of perceptual ROCF scores. Current study is an example of how classic 
psychological paradigms can be transferred into the virtual world. Further investigation of the distinct 
individual preferences in drawing tasks in VR could lead to a better understanding on how we process 
visuospatial information. As a result, such findings would inevitably extend to industrial applications.},

Despite the potential importance of IU, clinical data on the construct remains relatively scant and focused on generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The present study systematically investigated IU, as measured by the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 (IUS-12), across groups diagnosed with anxiety disorders (i.e., social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder) or depression (clinical sample: n=376; 61\% women), as well as undergraduate (n=428; 76\% women) and community samples (n=571; 67\% women). Analysis of variance revealed only one statistically significant difference in IUS-12 scores across diagnostic groups in the clinical sample; specifically, people with social anxiety disorder reported higher scores (p{\textless}.01; η2=.03) than people with panic disorder. People diagnosed with an anxiety disorder or depression reported significantly and substantially higher IUS-12 scores relative to community and undergraduate samples. Furthermore, IUS-12 score distributions were similar across diagnostic groups as demonstrated by Kernel density estimations, with the exception of panic disorder, which may have a relatively flat distribution of IU. Response patterns were invariant across diagnostic groups as demonstrated by multi-group confirmatory factor analyses, but varied between clinical and nonclinical samples. Overall, the findings suggest IU may serve as an important transdiagnostic feature across anxiety disorders and depression. In addition, robust support was found for the proposed 2-factor model of the IUS-12. Comprehensive findings, implications, and future research directions are discussed.},

This study examined the relationship between IU and social anxiety among 126 adults. Findings revealed that IU explained a significant amount of variance in social anxiety severity when controlling for established cognitive correlates of social anxiety (e.g., fear of negative evaluation) and for neuroticism. Furthermore, it was found that IU was related with symptom levels of GAD, OCD, and social anxiety, but not depression, when controlling the shared variance among these symptoms.},

The current study aims at investigating some issues in the assessment of Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) through the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised, a measure adapted from the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 to assess IU across the lifespan. In particular we address the factor structure among a large community sample, measurement invariance across gender, age, and over time, together with reliability and validity of the overall scale and its subscales. The questionnaire was administered to community (N = 761; mean age = 35.86 ± 14.01 years) and undergraduate (N = 163; mean age = 21.16 ± 2.64 years) participants, together with other self-report measures assessing constructs theoretically related to IU. The application of a bifactor model shows that the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised possesses a robust general factor, thus supporting the use of the unit-weighted total score of the questionnaire as a measure of the construct. Furthermore, measurement invariance across gender, age, and over time is supported. Finally, the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised appears to possess adequate reliability and validity. These findings support the unidimensionality of the measure, a conceptually reasonable result in line with the trans-diagnostic nature of Intolerance of Uncertainty. In addition, this study and comparison with published factor structures of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-12 and of the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised identify some issues for the internal structure of the measure. In particular, concern is expressed for the Prospective IU subscale. In light of the promising psychometric properties, the use of the Italian Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale-Revised as a univocal measure is encouraged in both research and clinical practice.},

	abstract = {This article seeks to place children on the autism spectrum at the center of a study examining the potential of virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMDs) used in classrooms. In doing so, we provide data that address 3 important and often overlooked research questions in the field of autism and technology, working in school-based settings with 31 autistic children from 6 to 16 years of age. First, what type of VR HMD device (and experiences therein) are preferred by children on the autism spectrum using HMDs (given possible sensory concerns). Second, how do children on the autism spectrum report the physical experience, enjoyment, and potential of VR HMDs in their classrooms? Finally, we were interested in exploring what children on the autism spectrum would like to use VR in schools for? Through a mixed methods approach, we found that costly and technologically advanced HMDs were preferred (namely: HTC Vive). In addition, HMDs were reported as being enjoyable, physically and visually comfortable, easy to use, and exciting, and children wanted to use them again. They identified several potential usages for HMDs, including relaxing/feeling calm, being able to explore somewhere virtually before visiting in the real world, and to develop learning opportunities in school. We discuss these findings in the context of VR in classrooms, in addition to considering limitations and implication of our findings.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the concepts of immersion and presence in virtual environments (VEs). We propose that the degree of immersion can be objectively assessed as the characteristics of a technology, and has dimensions such as the extent to which a display system can deliver an inclusive, extensive, surrounding, and vivid illusion of virtual environment to a participant. Other dimensions of immersion are concerned with the extent of body matching, and the extent to which there is a self-contained plot in which the participant can act and in which there is an autonomous response. Presence is a state of consciousness that may be concomitant with immersion, and is related to a sense of being in a place. Presence governs aspects of autonomie responses and higher-level behaviors of a participant in a VE. The paper considers single and multiparticipant shared environments, and draws on the experience of ComputerSupported Cooperative Working (CSCW) research as a guide to understanding presence in shared environments. The paper finally outlines the aims of the FIVE Working Group, and the 1995 FIVE Conference in London, UK.},

Specific fears and phobias can have a serious impact on young people with ASD and their families. In this study we developed and evaluated a unique treatment combining cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) with graduated exposure in a virtual reality environment (VRE). Nine verbally fluent boys with an ASD diagnosis and no reported learning disability, aged 7 to 13 years old, were recruited. Each had anxiety around a specific situation (e.g. crowded buses) or stimulus (e.g. pigeons). An individualised scene was recreated in our ‘wrap-around’ VRE. In the VRE participants were coached by a psychologist in cognitive and behavioural techniques (e.g. relaxation and breathing exercises) while the exposure to the phobia/fear stimulus was gradually increased as the child felt ready. Each child received four 20–30 minute sessions. After participating in the study, eight of the nine children were able to tackle their phobia situation. Four of the participants completely overcame their phobia. Treatment effects were maintained at 12 months. These results provide evidence that CBT with VRE can be a highly effective treatment for specific phobia/fear for some young people with ASD.

Two auditory stimuli (tone, siren) were repeated, whilst skin conductance responses were recorded to measure habituation. Detection thresholds were measured by stepwise reductions in tone volume. We found no evidence in favor of our hypotheses, but ASD adults did rate the auditory stimuli as more arousing. Based on explorative analyses, we argue that studying the strength of physiological responses to auditory stimuli is needed to understand auditory sensitivities.},

	abstract = {Background Atypical sensory responsivity and sensory interests are now included in the DSM 5 diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) under the broad domain of restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB). However, relatively little is known about the emergence of sensory-related features and their relation to conventionally defined RRB in the first years of life. Methods Prospective, longitudinal parent-report data using the Sensory Experiences Questionnaire (SEQ) were collected for 331 high-risk toddlers (74 of whom met diagnostic criteria for ASD at age 2) and 135 low-risk controls. Longitudinal profiles for SEQ scores were compared between groups across ages 12–24 months. Associations between SEQ measures and measures of RRB subtypes (based on the Repetitive Behavior Scale, Revised) were also examined. Results Longitudinal profiles for all SEQ scores significantly differed between groups. SEQ scores were elevated for the ASD group from age 12 months, with differences becoming more pronounced across the 12–24 month interval. At both 12 and 24 months, most measures derived from the SEQ were significantly associated with all subtypes of RRB. Conclusions These findings suggest that differences in sensory responsivity may be evident in high-risk infants later diagnosed with ASD in early toddlerhood, and that the magnitude of these differences increases over the second year of life. The high degree of association between SEQ scores and RRB supports the conceptual alignment of these features but also raises questions as to explanatory mechanisms.},

Using qualitative methods, this study aimed to characterise autistic visual sensory symptoms, contextualise their impact and document any associated coping strategies. A total of 18 autistic adults took part in four focus groups which involved questions around visual experiences, the impact of these on daily life, and strategies for their reduction. Transcripts of each session were thematically analysed allocating six key themes. Participants described a range of visual hypersensitivities, including to light, motion, patterns and particular colours, which contributed to distraction and were frequently part of a wider multisensory issue. Such experiences had significant negative impacts on personal wellbeing and daily life with participants describing fatigue, stress and hindrances on day-to-day activities (e.g. travel and social activities). However, the degree of understanding that participants had about their visual experiences influenced their emotional response, with greater understanding reducing concern. Participants employed a variety of coping strategies to overcome visual sensory experiences but with varied success. Discussions also highlighted that there may be a poor public understanding of sensory issues in autism affecting how well autistic individuals are able manage their sensory symptoms. In summary, autistic adults expressed significant concern about their visual experiences and there is a need to improve understanding of visual experiences on a personal and public level as well as for developing potential support and optometric treatment.},

	abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) technologies have shown potential for learning and assessment for children, adolescents, and adults with autism. Much of the research in this area has taken a conceptual stance of veridicality; that is, that VR offers promise because it can provide authenticity and levels of realism alongside stimulus or environmental control, or both, which may first facilitate learning and the generalization of skills to the real world, and secondly can provide experimental contexts with strong ecological validity for assessment. This conceptual review raises questions about the assumption of veridicality of VR for autism research by examining research literature that has used VR to support learning and to investigate social responding. In so doing, it provides a framework for examining the assumed relationship between virtual and real contexts in order to highlight particular features of design and interaction, as well as background characteristics of participants, that may help or hinder learning and understanding in virtual environments. The conclusions suggest there is a need for the field to systematically examine the different factors that influence responding in VR in order to understand when, and under what circumstances, the responses of individuals with autism can be considered appropriately authentic. There are also opportunities for thinking more radically about research directions by focusing on the strengths and preferences of people with autism, and promoting more participatory and inclusive approaches to research.},

We report results concerning cybersickness related with awareness of the secondary effects of VR before doing an experiment. Two groups of participant were found. A group that read the consent form (CF) with attention and a group that did not pay attention to the CF and just signed it. The consent contained information about the experiment and also an alert on the secondary effects of VR. In the VR experiment, participants were asked to accomplish a task in a virtual environment (VE) related with other study. Findings suggest that for those who read the consent form carefully, thus, were more aware about VR side effects, there were more symptoms of cybersickness and more withdraws. These reported results rise some practical and also ethical issues related with VR experiments that are discussed in this paper.},

	abstract = {In order to take advantage of the potential offered by the medium of virtual reality, it will be essential to develop an understanding of how to maximize the desirable experience of ‘presence’ in a virtual space (‘being there’), and how to minimize the undesirable feeling of ‘cybersickness’ (a constellation of discomfort symptoms experienced in virtual reality). Although there have been frequent reports of a possible link between the observer’s sense of presence and the experience of bodily discomfort in virtual reality, the amount of literature that discusses the nature of the relationship is limited. Recent research has underlined the possibility that these variables have shared causes, and that both factors may be manipulated with a single approach. This review paper summarizes the concepts of presence and cybersickness and highlights the strengths and gaps in our understanding about their relationship. We review studies that have measured the association between presence and cybersickness, and conclude that the balance of evidence favours a negative relationship between the two factors which is driven principally by sensory integration processes. We also discuss how system immersiveness might play a role in modulating both presence and cybersickness. However, we identify a serious absence of high-powered studies that aim to reveal the nature of this relationship. Based on this evidence we propose recommendations for future studies investigating presence, cybersickness, and other related factors.},

After a brief synopsis of the studies that plaid a pioneering role in the identification of the overlapping fields between alexithymia and ASD, we comb the literature for evidence of its overlap with ASD in terms of prevalence, etiology, and behaviors. Through a formalized framework of the process of emotional interpretation and expression, we explore evidence for where and how deficits arise in this complex network of events. We portray how these relate to the dynamic interplay between alexithymic and autistic traits and find emerging evidence that alexithymia is both a cause and consequence of autistic behaviors.

	abstract = {Purpose
The use of virtual reality (VR) technologies in the education of autistic children has been a focus of research for over two decades. It is argued that this form of technology can provide authentic “real world” contexts that target social and life skills training in safe, controllable and repeatable virtual environments. The development of affordable VR head-mounted displays (HMD), such as Google cardboard and Oculus Rift, has seen a renewed interest in their use for a wide range of applications, including the education of autistic individuals. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
A systematic search of electronic databases focussing on empirical studies on the use of VR-HMD for children and adults on the autism spectrum was undertaken.
A review of the literature identified a limited number of studies in this field characterised by differences in the type of application, technology used and participant characteristics.
Whilst there are some grounds for optimism, more research is needed on the use of this technology within educational settings to ensure robust recommendations can be made on the implementation, use and sustainability of this approach.
This paper is the first to consider the evidence base for the use of VR-HMD technology to support the needs of the autistic population.},

However, research is yet to explore the mediating relationships or sensory hyporeactivity, seeking and anxiety subtypes in preschool-age autistic children. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the relationships between sensory reactivity, intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety subtypes in a heterogeneous group of 54 preschool-age autistic children, age 3–5 years, using observation and parent-report assessments. Correlational analysis found sensory hyperreactivity, intolerance of uncertainty and total anxiety were significantly intercorrelated. In addition, sensory hyperreactivity was significantly correlated with separation anxiety when controlling for autism traits. Serial mediation analyses indicated significant full mediation between sensory hyperreactivity and anxiety through intolerance of uncertainty, and significant full mediation between sensory hyperreactivity and intolerance of uncertainty through anxiety. Our results suggest that sensory hyperreactivity is a key early factor in the development of anxiety, and supports that intolerance of uncertainty is an important interrelated construct in the development and maintenance of anxiety in autism. Our findings have important implications for the development of effective interventions. However, due to limitations with the measures, our research also highlights a pressing need for objective assessments of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty that can be used with preschool-age autistic children.},

Adults with autism spectrum disorder reported higher anxiety level, more loneliness, and higher scores on four sensory quadrants than neuro-typical adults. The predictors of the physical health domain were anxiety and sensation-sensitivity behaviors. Loneliness and sensation-sensitivity behaviors were predictive of the psychological health domain. Comorbid psychiatric disorders and loneliness were predictive of the social relationship domain.Conclusions: Adults with autism spectrum disorder need more supportive social contexts and interventions to improve their quality of life.

The study included 210 participants: 68 children with ASC, 79 with SPD and 63 TD children. The Sensory Processing Scale Inventory was used to measure sensory symptoms, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) to measure autistic traits, and the Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ) to measure cognitive styles. Across groups, a greater sensory symptomatology was associated with lower empathy. Further, both the ASC and SPD groups showed more sensory symptoms than TD children. Children with ASC and SPD only differed on sensory under-reactivity. The ASD group did, however, show lower empathy and higher systemizing scores than the SPD group. Together, this suggest that sensory symptoms alone may not be adequate to differentiate children with ASC and SPD but that cognitive style measures could be used for differential diagnosis.},

Alexithymia is known to be much more common in adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) compared with the typically developing (TD) adult population. However, we know very little about alexithymia in young children with ASD and advancing our understanding of this topic may be of critical clinical and translational importance. Here, we present the first study to examine alexithymia in children with ASD. We find that alexithymia is substantially elevated in ASD on both self- and parent-report measures. Despite both measures being sensitive to on-average group differentiation, we find no evidence of correlation between such measures, indicating that children and their parents may be using different sources of information. Parent-rated alexithymia is also associated with increasing levels of autistic traits. Discrepancy between self and other alexithymia ratings are also associated with autistic traits, but only in ASD. These results underscore the idea that assessing alexithymia in ASD at younger ages may help identify important subgroups that have particular difficulties in the domain of emotion processing.

Little is known about the factors impacting on learning for autistic pupils, even though academic outcomes are highly heterogeneous. The aim of the current study was to qualitatively explore factors that are perceived to impact positively (i.e. facilitators) and negatively (i.e. barriers) upon learning for primary school pupils with an Autism Spectrum Disorder diagnosis.
Method
Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten teachers currently engaged in teaching autistic pupils, which were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results
Three key themes were identified: pupil’s behaviours and abilities (factors related to the child’s behaviour, cognition or personality), academic environment (physical and contextual), and teacher skills and qualities (e.g. training, trust and relationships).
Conclusions
A range of factors were therefore identified by teachers, some of which corroborate with existing research, while other findings provide novel insights. Priorities for facilitating learning are discussed, as well as key areas for future investigation and potential intervention.},

Parents and their autistic children diverge regarding the severity of the youth’s executive function difficulties, but both emphasize flexibility problems within their profile of executive function challenges. Intraclass correlation coefficients between parent and youth ratings were moderate to poor in the autistic group, indicating that autistic youth report adds important information beyond that captured by their parents’ report. These data elevate the importance of asking autistic youth directly about their own executive function.},

	abstract = {Intolerance of uncertainty is the tendency of an individual to consider the possibility of a negative event occurring unacceptable, irrespective of the probability of occurrence. It is a key component of worry, state anxiety, and related anxiety pathologies. The 27-item Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (IUS) was developed to measure intolerance of uncertainty. Previous psychometric analyses of the IUS have suggested both four- and five-factor models. High inter-item correlations, factor instability, and previous theoretical research support the development of a reduced measure. The present study used two undergraduate samples and evaluated a psychometrically stable 12-item two-factor version of the IUS. The reduced measure (IUS-12) retained exemplary internal consistency, while correlating extremely well with the original IUS and related measures of anxiety and worry. The IUS-12 also demonstrated a stable two-factor structure, representing both anxious and avoidance components of intolerance of uncertainty. Directions for future research and potential applications for assessment are discussed.},

Affective computing research has mostly used non-immersive two-dimensional (2D) images or videos to elicit emotional states. However, immersive virtual reality, which allows researchers to simulate environments in controlled laboratory conditions with high levels of sense of presence and interactivity, is becoming more popular in emotion research. Moreover, its synergy with implicit measurements and machine-learning techniques has the potential to impact transversely in many research areas, opening new opportunities for the scientific community. This paper presents a systematic review of the emotion recognition research undertaken with physiological and behavioural measures using head-mounted displays as elicitation devices. The results highlight the evolution of the field, give a clear perspective using aggregated analysis, reveal the current open issues and provide guidelines for future research.},

Up to the present, elicitation has been carried out with non-immersive stimuli. This study, on the other hand, aims to develop an emotion recognition system for affective states evoked through Immersive Virtual Environments. Four alternative virtual rooms were designed to elicit four possible arousal-valence combinations, as described in each quadrant of the Circumplex Model of Affects. An experiment involving the recording of the electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) of sixty participants was carried out. A set of features was extracted from these signals using various state-of-the-art metrics that quantify brain and cardiovascular linear and nonlinear dynamics, which were input into a Support Vector Machine classifier to predict the subject’s arousal and valence perception. The model’s accuracy was 75.00\% along the arousal dimension and 71.21\% along the valence dimension. Our findings validate the use of Immersive Virtual Environments to elicit and automatically recognize different emotional states from neural and cardiac dynamics; this development could have novel applications in fields as diverse as Architecture, Health, Education and Videogames.},

Results showed that overall, young and middle-aged participants that had received the training scored significantly higher on facial, vocal, and audiovisual emotion recognition than the control groups. The training effect for audiovisual ERA persisted over 4 weeks. In older adults (59–90 years), however, the training had no effect. The new, brief training could be useful in applied settings such as professional training, at least for younger and middle-aged adults. In older adults, improving ERA might require a longer and more interactive intervention.},

	abstract = {Persons who suffer from schizophrenia have difficulties in recognizing emotions in others’ facial expressions, which affects their capabilities for social interaction and hinders their social integration. Photographic images have traditionally been used to explore emotion recognition impairments in schizophrenia patients, but they lack of the dynamism that is inherent to facial expressiveness. In order to overcome those inconveniences, over the last years different authors have proposed the use of virtual avatars. In this work, we present the results of a pilot study that explored the possibilities of using a realistic-looking avatar for the assessment of emotion recognition deficits in patients who suffer from schizophrenia. In the study, 20 subjects with schizophrenia of long evolution and 20 control subjects were invited to recognize a set of facial expressions of emotions showed by both the said virtual avatar and static images. Our results show that schizophrenic patients exhibit recognition deficits in emotion recognition from facial expressions regardless the type of stimuli (avatar or images), and that those deficits are related with the psychopathology. Finally, some improvements in recognition rates (RRs) for the patient group when using the avatar were observed for sadness or surprise expressions, and they even outperform the control group in the recognition of the happiness expression. This leads to conclude that, apart from the dynamism of the shown expression, the RRs for schizophrenia patients when employing animated avatars may depend on other factors which need to be further explored.},

However, an effective stress-level monitoring method is still not available. This paper presents a quantitative method for monitoring acute stress levels in healthy young people using biomarkers from physiological signals that can be unobtrusively monitored. Two states were induced to 40 volunteers, a basal state generated with a relaxation task and an acute stress state generated by applying a standard stress test that includes five different tasks. Standard psychological questionnaires and biochemical markers were utilized as ground truth of stress levels. A multivariable approach to comprehensively measure the physiological stress response is proposed using stress biomarkers derived from skin temperature, heart rate, and pulse wave signals. Acute physiological stress levels (total-range 0–100 au) were continuously estimated every 1 min showing medians of 29.06 au in the relaxation tasks, while rising from 34.58 to 47.55 au in the stress tasks. Moreover, using the proposed method, five statistically different stress levels induced by the performed tasks were also measured. Results obtained show that, in these experimental conditions, stress can be monitored from unobtrusive biomarkers. Thus, a more general stress monitoring method could be derived based on this approach.},

The dataset contains information about electrocardiogram, 5 facials electromyographies, electrodermal activity, and respiration. Furthermore, we have asked the players to self-assess their emotional state on the Arousal and Valence space. We have then analyzed the contribution of each physiological signal to the overall definition of the players’ mental state. Finally, we have applied Machine Learning techniques to predict the emotional state of players during game sessions at a precision of one second. The obtained results can contribute to define game devices and engines able to detect physiological data, as well to improve the game design process.},

Many of the methods used in participatory research are drawn from mainstream disciplines and conventional research itself involves varying degrees of participation. The key difference between participatory and conventional methodologies lies in the location of power in the research process. We review some of the participatory methodologies which are currently being popularized in health research, focusing on the issue of control over the research process.

Arnstein's model, however, by solely emphasizing power, limits effective responses to the challenge of involving users in services and undermines the potential of the user involvement process. Such an emphasis on power assumes that it has a common basis for users, providers and policymakers and ignores the existence of different relevant forms of knowledge and expertise. It also fails to recognise that for some users, participation itself may be a goal. We propose a new model to replace the static image of a ladder and argue that for user involvement to improve health services it must acknowledge the value of the process and the diversity of knowledge and experience of both health professionals and lay people.},

	abstract = {Background There have been repeated calls to better involve patients and the public and to place them at the centre of healthcare. Serious clinical and service failings in the UK and internationally increase the urgency and importance of addressing this problem. Despite this supportive policy context, progress to achieve greater involvement is patchy and slow and often concentrated at the lowest levels of involvement.
Methods A selective narrative literature search was guided by the authors’ broad expertise, covering a range of disciplines across health and social care, policy and research. Published systematic literature reviews were used to identify relevant authors and publications. Google and hand searches of journal articles and reference lists and reports augmented identification of recent evidence.
Results Patients and the wider public can be involved at most stages of healthcare, and this can have a number of benefits. Uncertainty persists about why and how to do involvement well and evaluate its impact, how to involve and support a diversity of individuals, and in ways that allow them to work in partnership to genuinely influence decision-making. This exposes patient and public involvement (PPI) to criticisms of exclusivity and tokenism.
Conclusions Current models of PPI are too narrow, and few organisations mention empowerment or address equality and diversity in their involvement strategies. These aspects of involvement should receive greater attention, as well as the adoption of models and frameworks that enable power and decision-making to be shared more equitably with patients and the public in designing, planning and co-producing healthcare.},

We interviewed 25 researchers (14 early career and 11 established researchers) about their views and experiences of participatory autism research. Through reflexive thematic analysis of interview and focus group data, we identified three themes. First, our participants emphasised the flexible nature of participatory research, and the many forms it can take; yet noted that this flexibility could cause confusion. Second, our participants highlighted the importance of building relationships with research partners, while commenting on the challenges around effective communication and working with diverse groups of people who may have limited research experience. Finally, participants described the challenges of working within academic environments that are not conducive to participatory research (e.g. due to limited time, funding and support). We discuss these issues with regard to changes required at both an individual and systemic level, ensuring that efforts are made to meaningfully involve autistic people and their allies in all stages of the research process.},

The process of synthesising the views, knowledge and expertise of key stakeholders with either a lived or shared experience of autism is invaluable and can inform future research to ensure that it is meaningful and has the greatest impact. A number of studies have reported on the research priorities of groups within the autism community, but to date, these studies stand alone and priorities have not been considered collectively. This systematic review identified seven studies that reported on key stakeholders’ priorities for autism research. Studies were synthesised according to (a) the target participant group and method of recruitment, (b) the methodology used to elucidate the viewpoint of stakeholders, (c) the country of stakeholders and (d) commonly identified priorities. Common features across studies note the importance of prioritising initiatives that will result in real-world changes in the lives of the autism community and more research across the lifespan. There is an identified need for more diverse stakeholder voices to influence the identification of priorities for future research foci. Continued inclusion of the autistic and autism communities in priority-setting research is imperative for achieving significant outcomes in autism research and to progress the field in an effective and socio-ethical way.},

In the past few decades, across many fields of inquiry and outside the academy there has been a surge of interest in critiquing "the deficit view" of all manner of group differences and deviations from the norm.  But what exactly is meant by "deficit view" and related terms when they figure in accounts of human differences?  Do critics of the deficit view claim that they are never appropriate or that particular applications of the approach are inappropriate?  The aim of this paper is twofold: to identify and articulate some of the conceptual issues at the heart of debates about deficit approaches and to examine how these issues matter. Autism is my focus case. As we will see, many critiques of the deficit view of autism tend to characterize what is problematic about taking a deficit view in terms of the personal and social harm that deficit views can or do effect.  One important upshot of my discussion, I argue, is that there is another kind of drawback to deficit thinking that is independent of the deficit view's potential negative personal and social consequences, a drawback that deserves serious consideration and sustained critical attention: in some instances, at least, deficit views impede scientific and philosophical progress in our understanding of the phenomena themselves.  Thus, articulating and assessing deficit approaches is of practical and theoretical importance.},

Increasingly, there have been calls from the autistic community and, more recently, nonautistic researchers, to rethink the way in which autism science is framed and conducted. Neurodiversity, where autism is seen as one form of variation within a diversity of minds, has been proposed as a potential alternative paradigm. In this review, we concentrate on three major challenges to the conventional medical paradigm – an overfocus on deficits, an emphasis on the individual as opposed to their broader context and a narrowness of perspective – each of which necessarily constrains what we can know about autism and how we are able to know it. We then outline the ways in which fundamental elements of the neurodiversity paradigm can potentially help researchers respond to the medical model’s limitations. We conclude by considering the implications of a shift towards the neurodiversity paradigm for autism science.},

Aligned with progressive theoretical frameworks, emerging empirical research indicates that mismatches in communication styles can contribute to autistic social difficulties and the important role that nonautistic difficulties play. We highlight two areas of future research with the aim of providing empirical support for the views that the autistic community has proposed over the past 2 decades. We discuss the impact of such a paradigm shift on a number of levels, including how bridging the gap between different interaction styles can reduce stigma and increase understanding. Adopting such a framework will provide radical opportunities for transformative societal changes and education around inclusion.},

	abstract = {The Double Empathy Problem suggests that communicative difficulties between autistic and non-autistic people are due to bi-directional differences in communicative style and a reciprocal lack of understanding. If true, there should be increased similarity in interaction style, resulting in higher rapport during interactions between pairs of the same neurotype. Here, we provide two empirical tests of rapport, with data revealing whether self- and observer- rated rapport varies depending on the match or mismatch in autism status within a pair. An additional opportunity afforded by these data is to examine the effect of the autism status of the rater on the perceived rapport between matched and mismatched pairs. In Study 1 72 participants were allocated to one of three dyad conditions: autistic pairs (n = 24), non-autistic pairs (n = 24) and mixed pairs (n = 12 autistic; n = 12 non-autistic). Each participant completed three semi-structured interactions with their partner, rating rapport after each interaction. Non-autistic pairs experienced higher self-rated rapport than mixed and autistic pairs, and autistic pairs experienced higher rapport than mixed pairs. In Study 2 (n = 80) autistic and non-autistic observers rated interactional rapport while watching videoed interactions between autistic pairs, non-autistic pairs, and mixed pairs (n = 18, a subset of participants in Study 1). Mixed pairs were rated significantly lower on rapport than autistic and non-autistic pairs, and autistic pairs were rated more highly for rapport than non-autistic pairs. Both autistic and non-autistic observers show similar patterns in how they rate the rapport of autistic, non-autistic, and mixed pairs. In summary, autistic people experience high interactional rapport when interacting with other autistic people, and this is also detected by external observers. Rather than autistic people experiencing low rapport in all contexts, their rapport ratings are influenced by a mismatch of diagnosis. These findings suggest that autistic people possess a distinct mode of social interaction style, rather than demonstrating social skills deficits. These data are considered in terms of their implications for psychological theories of autism, as well as practical impact on educational and clinical practice.},

As autism is clinically defined by social communication deficits, it may be expected that information transfer between autistic people would be particularly deficient. However, the Double Empathy theory would suggest that communication difficulties arise from a mismatch in neurotype; and thus information transfer between autistic people may be more successful than information transfer between an autistic and a non-autistic person. We investigate this by examining information transfer between autistic adults, non-autistic adults and mixed autistic-with-non-autistic pairs. Initial participants were told a story which they recounted to a second participant, who recounted the story to a third participant and so on, along a ‘diffusion chain’ of eight participants (n = 72). We found a significantly steeper decline in detail retention in the mixed chains, while autistic chains did not significantly differ from non-autistic chains. Participant rapport ratings revealed significantly lower scores for mixed chains. These results challenge the diagnostic criterion that autistic people lack the skills to interact successfully. Rather, autistic people effectively share information with each other. Information transfer selectively degrades more quickly in mixed pairs, in parallel with a reduction in rapport.},

The current study examined how the perception of social interaction in the CVRE is influenced by variations in how much the avatar resembles a human being in appearance and behavior. We measured the extent to which virtual representations were both perceived and treated as if they were human, via self-report questionnaire. Interactive effect for visual fidelity and behavioral fidelity of the avatar was found, suggesting that evaluating the effect of visual fidelity on social interaction without taking

	abstract = {The visual representation of human-like entities in virtual worlds is becoming a very important aspect as virtual reality becomes more and more “social”. The visual representation of a character’s resemblance to a real person and the emotional response to it, as well as the expectations raised, have been a topic of discussion for several decades and have been debated by scientists from different disciplines. But as with any new technology, the findings may need to be reevaluated and adapted to new modalities. In this context, we make two contributions which may have implications for how avatars should be represented in social virtual reality applications. First, we determine how default and customized characters of current social virtual reality platforms appear in terms of human likeness, eeriness, and likability, and whether there is a clear resemblance to a given person. It can be concluded that the investigated platforms vary strongly in their representation of avatars. Common to all is that a clear resemblance does not exist. Second, we show that the uncanny valley effect is also present in head-mounted displays, but—compared to 2D monitors—even more pronounced.},

We evaluated four distinct avatars presenting an increasing level of anthropomorphism in their detailed compositions. Our results revealed that each avatar elicited a relatively high level of illusion. However both machine-like and cartoon-like avatars elicited an equivalent IVBO, slightly superior to the human-ones. A realistic human appearance is therefore not a critical top-down factor of IVBO, and could lead to an Uncanny Valley effect.},

At different times during an experience, a participant will occasionally switch between interpreting the totality of sensory inputs as forming the VE or the real world. The number of transitions from virtual to real is counted, and, using some simplifying assumptions, a probabilistic Markov chain model can be constructed to model these transitions. This model can be used to estimate the equilibrium probability of being “present” in the VE. This technique was applied in the context of an experiment to assess the relationship between presence and body movement in an immersive VE. The movement was that required by subjects to reach out and touch successive pieces on a three-dimensional chess board. The experiment included twenty subjects, ten of whom had to reach out to touch the chess pieces (the active group) and ten of whom only had to click a handheld mouse button (the control group). The results revealed a significant positive association in the active group between body movement and presence. The results lend support to interaction paradigms that are based on maximizing the match between sensory data and proprioception.},

A behavioral measure of the rubber hand illusion (RHI) is a drift of the perceived position of one's own hand toward the rubber hand. The authors investigated (a) the influence of general body scheme representations on the RHI in Experiments 1 and 2 and (b) the necessary conditions of visuotactile stimulation underlying the RHI in Experiments 3 and 4. Overall, the results suggest that at the level of the process underlying the build up of the RHI, bottom-up processes of visuotactile correlation drive the illusion as a necessary, but not sufficient, condition. Conversely, at the level of the phenomenological content, the illusion is modulated by top-down influences originating from the representation of one's own body.

As we enter the twenty-first century, immersive virtual environment technology promises new experimental venues in which researchers can study proxemics. Immersive virtual environments provide realistic and compelling experimental settings without sacrificing experimental control. The experiment reported here tested Argyle and Dean's (1965) equilibrium theory's specification of an inverse relationship between mutual gaze, a nonverbal cue signaling intimacy, and interpersonal distance. Participants were immersed in a three-dimensional virtual room in which a virtual human representation (that is, an embodied agent) stood. Under the guise of a memory task, participants walked towards and around the agent. Distance between the participant and agent was tracked automatically via our immersive virtual environment system. All participants maintained more space around agents than they did around similarly sized and shaped but nonhuman-like objects. Female participants maintained more interpersonal distance between themselves and agents who engaged them in eye contact (that is, mutual gaze behavior) than between themselves and agents who did not engage them in eye contact, whereas male participants did not. Implications are discussed for the study of proxemics via immersive virtual environment technology, as well as the design of virtual environments and virtual humans.},

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available.

Recent studies have shown that this feeling can be elicited by entities modeled not only on humans but also nonhuman animals. The perceptual and cognitive mechanisms underlying the UV effect are not well understood, although many theories have been proposed to explain them. To test the predictions of nine classes of theories, a within-subjects experiment was conducted with 136 participants. The theories’ predictions were compared with ratings of 10 classes of stimuli on eeriness and coldness indices. One type of theory, configural processing, predicted eight out of nine significant effects. Atypicality, in its extended form, in which the uncanny valley effect is amplified by the stimulus appearing more human, also predicted eight. Threat avoidance predicted seven; atypicality, perceptual mismatch, and mismatch+ predicted six; category+, novelty avoidance, mate selection, and psychopathy avoidance predicted five; and category uncertainty predicted three. Empathy's main prediction was not supported. Given that the number of significant effects predicted depends partly on our choice of hypotheses, a detailed consideration of each result is advised. We do, however, note the methodological value of examining many competing theories in the same experiment.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in neuroimaging research support the increased use of naturalistic stimulus material such as film, avatars, or androids. These stimuli allow for a better understanding of how the brain processes information in complex situations while maintaining experimental control. While avatars and androids are well suited to study human cognition, they should not be equated to human stimuli. For example, the uncanny valley hypothesis theorizes that artificial agents with high human-likeness may evoke feelings of eeriness in the human observer. Here we review if, when, and how the perception of human-like avatars and androids differs from the perception of humans and consider how this influences their utilization as stimulus material in social and affective neuroimaging studies. First, we discuss how the appearance of virtual characters affects perception. When stimuli are morphed across categories from non-human to human, the most ambiguous stimuli, rather than the most human-like stimuli, show prolonged classification times and increased eeriness. Human-like to human stimuli show a positive linear relationship with familiarity. Secondly, we show that expressions of emotions in human-like avatars can be perceived similarly to human emotions, with corresponding behavioral, physiological and neuronal activations, with exception of physical dissimilarities. Subsequently, we consider if and when one perceives differences in action representation by artificial agents versus humans. Motor resonance and predictive coding models may account for empirical findings, such as an interference effect on action for observed human-like, natural moving characters. However, the expansion of these models to explain more complex behavior, such as empathy, still needs to be investigated in more detail. Finally, we broaden our outlook to social interaction, where virtual reality stimuli can be utilized to imitate complex social situations.},

With this development comes the need for further investigation into the role it plays on people’s responses to characters. Whether or not these improvements make any difference to the perception and response towards the virtual character was the central question of the present study. In order to evaluate this, we designed a within-subjects experiment, where participants were embodied in a high-fidelity virtual body in VR and were observing an animated character, rendered in photorealistic and simplified style. The character displayed a simple interactive behaviour with the participant (eye-gaze) and was designed to express an emotional reaction to induce an empathetic response in participants. Our goal was to evaluate if photorealism alone is enough to increase self-reported and behavioural signs (interpersonal distance or proximity) of social presence, place illusion, and empathetic concern for the character in virtual reality. This was found to be the case for self-reported social presence and place illusion, while empathetic concern depended on the order of condition. behavioural measure proximity was not affected by render style.},

Twenty-one responses were collected through a five-point Likert scale questionnaire and the NASA TLX. Results from questionnaires were not statistically different. However, the emotionally responsive Diana obtained more positive responses, and people spent the longest time with the mimicry Diana.

We analyzed the quantitative and qualitative measures associated with participants' emotional state at four distinct time-steps in the simulated interpersonal experience as the virtual patient's medical condition deteriorated. Results suggest that participants in the dynamic condition with animations exhibited a higher sense of co-presence and greater emotional response as compared to participants in the static condition, corresponding to the deterioration in the medical condition of the virtual patient. Negative affect of participants in the dynamic condition increased at a higher rate than for participants in the static condition.

Interventions targeting attention or FAR per se have invariably yielded improved FAR performance in these patients. Here, we compared the effects of two interventions, one targeting FAR and one targeting attention-to-facial-features, with treatment-as-usual on patients’ FAR performance. Thirty-nine outpatients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to one of three groups: FAR intervention (training to recognize emotional information, conveyed by changes in facial features), attention-to-facial-features intervention (training to detect changes in facial features), and treatment-as-usual. Also, 24 healthy controls, matched for age and education, were assigned to one of the two interventions. Two FAR measurements, baseline and post-intervention, were conducted using an original experimental procedure with alternative sets of stimuli. We found improved FAR performance following the intervention targeting FAR in comparison to the other patient groups, which in fact was comparable to the pre-intervention performance of healthy controls in the corresponding intervention group. This improvement was more pronounced in recognizing fear. Our findings suggest that compared to interventions targeting attention, and treatment-as-usual, training programs targeting FAR can be more effective in improving FAR in patients with schizophrenia, particularly assisting them in perceiving threat-related information more accurately.},

	abstract = {Advancements in real-time rendering technology have continued to develop rapidly over the course of the last decade. Consequently, human likenesses have been represented virtually with increasingly impressive detail. There is evidence that this increased resemblance to real humans has an observable and wide-ranging set of effects on human perception, cognition and action in situations that involve digital characters. Studies that seek to advance the science of synthetic animated people have consistently aimed to measure and quantify changes in perceived emotional content mediated through artificial human likenesses. The present study has been built off of this work. The experiment outlined here was constructed to define and measure responses from human participants towards state-of-the-art photorealistic virtual humans under affected conditions. In particular, we sought evidence for changes in perceptions of human likeness, eeriness and attractiveness that could be observably dependent on conditions of photorealism and character representation.},

	abstract = {Objective:To present the results of a systematic review of literature published between 1980 and 2004 reporting findings of the prevalence and incidence of anxiety disorders in the general population.Method:A literature search of epidemiologic studies of anxiety disorders was conducted, using MEDLINE and HealthSTAR databases, canvassing English-language publications. Eligible publications were restricted to studies that examined age ranges covering the adult population. A set of predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies. Prevalence and incidence data were extracted and analyzed for heterogeneity.Results:A total of 41 prevalence and 5 incidence studies met eligibility criteria. We found heterogeneity across 1-year and lifetime prevalence rates of all anxiety disorder categories. Pooled 1-year and lifetime prevalence rates for total anxiety disorders were 10.6\% and 16.6\%. Pooled rates for individual disorders varied widely. Women had generally higher prevalence rates across all anxiety disorder categories, compared with men, but the magnitude of this difference varied.Conclusion:The international prevalence of anxiety disorders varies greatly between published epidemiologic reports. The variability associated with all anxiety disorders is considerably smaller than the variability associated with individual disorders. Women report higher rates of anxiety disorders than men. Several factors were found to be associated with heterogeneity among rates, including diagnostic criteria, diagnostic instrument, sample size, country studied, and response rate.},

We sought to develop a short, yet reliable and valid form of these scales for use in circumstances where the full‐form is not feasible. We abbreviated the scales using item response theory analyses to retain the items that could discriminate the best among participants. One sample (N = 922) completed the state scale, a second sample (N = 2227) completed the trait scale, while a third sample (N = 250) completed the short forms. Our participants completed the Hungarian version of STAI alongside other measures to observe external validity. We calculated cut-off scores for the state ({\textgreater}9.5,) and trait ({\textgreater}13.5) scales. A total of 19.5\% and 20.1\% of the respondents reached the cut-off scores. The five-item short forms of STAI had sound psychometric properties that are comparable to those obtained on the full-form. The external validity of the scales is also demonstrated. We report detailed descriptive statistics that could be used in further studies as standards. The short scales are reliable measures that could be used in clinical screening and behavioural research; especially where practical considerations preclude the use of a longer questionnaire.},

	abstract = {There has been growing awareness of the concern expressed by autism communities that the majority of research conducted does not reflect the priorities or needs of autistic people and their families. Further, many autistic people report that they feel unable to influence research and desire greater involvement in the research process. Our research generated practical guidelines for researchers to consider when conducting autism research, in order to increase involvement, collaboration and trust between researchers and the autism community. These guidelines are based on the output of focus groups and interview discussions with twenty-two autistic adults and eight parents of autistic children, conducted during a series of workshops carried out as a collaboration between the research network Autism@Manchester and Salfordautism, an autism support group led and run by autistic professionals., The guidelines are organised into four sections: (1) pre-study considerations, (2) recruitment of participants, (3) study visit considerations and (4) post-study considerations. These sections are structured to reflect the research pathway, to allow researchers to understand more easily how to incorporate the recommendations into their research. The recommendations promote effective communication and equal partnerships between the autism and research communities, so that the needs of participants pre-research, during and post- research are taken into account, and so that participants are supported to become involved in research at the level they choose. It is hoped that by implementing transparent and participatory approaches to their work, researchers might be able to reduce some of the dissatisfaction that members of the autism community feel towards research, leading to higher standards in autism research.},

Research into effective ways of responding to the immediate needs of autistic people is, however, less advanced, as are efforts at translating basic science research into service provision. Involving community members in research is one potential way of reducing this gap. This study therefore investigated the views of community involvement in autism research both from the perspectives of autism researchers and of community members, including autistic adults, family members and practitioners. Results from a large-scale questionnaire study (n = 1,516) showed that researchers perceive themselves to be engaged with the autism community but that community members, most notably autistic people and their families, did not share this view. Focus groups/interviews with 72 participants further identified the potential benefits and remaining challenges to involvement in research, especially regarding the distinct perspectives of different stakeholders. Researchers were skeptical about the possibilities of dramatically increasing community engagement, while community members themselves spoke about the challenges to fully understanding and influencing the research process. We suggest that the lack of a shared approach to community engagement in UK autism research represents a key roadblock to translational endeavors.},

	abstract = {Objective
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is associated with amplified emotional responses and poor emotional control, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms. This article provides a conceptual and methodologic framework for understanding compromised emotion regulation (ER) in ASD.
Method
After defining ER and related constructs, methods to study ER were reviewed with special consideration on how to apply these approaches to ASD. Against the backdrop of cognitive characteristics in ASD and existing ER theories, available research was examined to identify likely contributors to emotional dysregulation in ASD.
Results
Little is currently known about ER in youth with ASD. Some mechanisms that contribute to poor ER in ASD may be shared with other clinical populations (e.g., physiologic arousal, degree of negative and positive affect, alterations in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex), whereas other mechanisms may be more unique to ASD (e.g., differences in information processing/perception, cognitive factors [e.g., rigidity], less goal-directed behavior and more disorganized emotion in ASD).
Conclusions
Although assignment of concomitant psychiatric diagnoses is warranted in some cases, poor ER may be inherent in ASD and may provide a more parsimonious conceptualization for the many associated socioemotional and behavioral problems in this population. Further study of ER in youth with ASD may identify meaningful subgroups of patients and lead to more effective individualized treatments.},

In the perceptual-cognitive skills area there are also systems that have some similar characteristics, use many of the same technologies, and are employed for sport training but do not meet the definition of a VE. The potential advantages of using a VE for training perceptual-cognitive skills in sports can be seen by looking at some of the evidence-based principles that have been proposed for practice design. When assessing the effectiveness of a sports training VE, it is essential to separate primary and secondary evaluation criteria. Psychological fidelity refers to the extent to which a VE recreates the perceptual-cognitive demands of the real task and leads to similar behaviours being observed from the user as in the real environment. Given the evidence for specificity of practice, it is likely that psychological fidelity is more strongly related to transfer of training than physical fidelity.},

	abstract = {Detecting and measuring emotional responses while interacting with virtual reality (VR), and assessing and interpreting their impacts on human engagement and “immersion,” are both academically and technologically challenging. While many researchers have, in the past, focused on the affective evaluation of passive environments, such as listening to music or the observation of videos and imagery, virtual realities and related interactive environments have been used in only a small number of research studies as a mean of presenting emotional stimuli. This article reports the first stage (focusing on participants' subjective responses) of a range of experimental investigations supporting the evaluation of emotional responses within a virtual environment, according to a three-dimensional (Valence, Arousal, and Dominance) model of affects, developed in the 1970s and 1980s. To populate this three-dimensional model with participants' emotional responses, an “affective VR,” capable of manipulating users' emotions, has been designed and subjectively evaluated. The VR takes the form of a dynamic “speedboat” simulation, elements (controllable VR parameters) of which were assessed and selected based on a 35-respondent online survey, coupled with the implementation of an affective power approximation algorithm. A further 68 participants took part in a series of trials, interacting with a number of VR variations, while subjectively rating their emotional responses. The experimental results provide an early level of confidence that this particular affective VR is capable of manipulating individuals' emotional experiences, through the control of its internal parameters. Moreover, the approximation technique proved to be fairly reliable in predicting users' potential emotional responses, in various affective VR settings, prior to actual experiences. Finally, the analysis suggested that the emotional response of the users, with different gender and gaming experiences, could vary, when presented with the same affective VR situation.},

	abstract = {New computer technologies, like virtual reality (VR), have created opportunities to study human behavior and train skills in novel ways. VR holds significant promise for maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of skill learning in a variety of settings (e.g., sport, medicine, safety-critical industries) through immersive learning and augmentation of existing training methods. In many cases the adoption of VR for training has, however, preceded rigorous testing and validation of the simulation tool. In order for VR to be implemented successfully for both training and psychological experimentation it is necessary to first establish whether the simulation captures fundamental features of the real task and environment, and elicits realistic behaviors. Unfortunately evaluation of VR environments too often confuses presentation and function, and relies on superficial visual features that are not the key determinants of successful training outcomes. Therefore evidence-based methods of establishing the fidelity and validity of VR environments are required. To this end, we outline a taxonomy of the subtypes of fidelity and validity, and propose a variety of practical methods for testing and validating VR training simulations. Ultimately, a successful VR environment is one that enables transfer of learning to the real-world. We propose that key elements of psychological, affective and ergonomic fidelity, are the real determinants of successful transfer. By adopting an evidence-based approach to VR simulation design and testing it is possible to develop valid environments that allow the potential of VR training to be maximized.},

Our critical review of the PR literature culminates in the development of an integrative practice framework that features five essential domains and provides a structured process for developing and maintaining PR partnerships, designing and implementing PR efforts, and evaluating the intermediate and long-term outcomes of descriptive, etiological, and intervention PR studies. We review the empirical and nonempirical literature in the context of this practice framework to distill the key challenges and added value of PR. Advances to the practice of PR over the next decade will require establishing the effectiveness of PR in achieving health outcomes and linking PR practices, processes, and core elements to health outcomes.},

Few studies within the field of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorders, have involved autistic individuals as partners. This study sought to identify and characterize published participatory research partnerships between researchers and individuals with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders and examine the influence of participatory research partnerships on the research process and reported study outcomes. A search of databases and review of gray literature identified seven studies that described participatory research partnerships between academic researchers and individuals with autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders. A comparative analysis of the studies revealed two key themes: (1) variations in the participatory research design and (2) limitations during the reporting of the depth of the partner’s involvement. Both themes potentially limit the application and generalizability of the findings. The results of the review are discussed in relation to the use of evaluative frameworks for such participatory research studies to determine the potential benefits of participatory research partnerships within the neurodevelopmental and autism spectrum disorder populations.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of avatar realism on embodiment and social interactions in Virtual Reality (VR). We compared abstract avatar representations based on a wooden mannequin with high fidelity avatars generated from photogrammetry 3D scan methods. Both avatar representations were alternately applied to participating users and to the virtual counterpart in dyadic social encounters to examine the impact of avatar realism on self-embodiment and social interaction quality. Users were immersed in a virtual room via a head mounted display (HMD). Their full-body movements were tracked and mapped to respective movements of their avatars. Embodiment was induced by presenting the users' avatars to themselves in a virtual mirror. Afterwards they had to react to a non-verbal behavior of a virtual interaction partner they encountered in the virtual space. Several measures were taken to analyze the effect of the appearance of the users' avatars as well as the effect of the appearance of the others' avatars on the users. The realistic avatars were rated significantly more human-like when used as avatars for the others and evoked a stronger acceptance in terms of virtual body ownership (VBO). There also was some indication of a potential uncanny valley. Additionally, there was an indication that the appearance of the others' avatars impacts the self-perception of the users.},

We undertook an exploratory in-the-wild study using Samsung Gear VR headsets to see how existing social groups that had become geographically dispersed could use VR for collaborative activities. The study showed a strong propensity for users to feel present and engaged with group members. Users were able to bring group behaviors into the virtual world. To overcome some technical limitations, they had to create novel forms of interaction. Overall, the study found that users experience a range of emotional states in VR that are broadly similar to those that they would experience face-to-face in the same groups. The study highlights the transferability of existing social group dynamics in VR interactions but suggests that more work would need to be done on avatar representations to support some intimate conversations.},

However, self-identification, the process of identifying a representation as being oneself, poses new challenges because a key determinant is that we see and have agency in our own face. Providing control over the face is hard with current HMD technologies because face tracking is either cumbersome or error prone. However, limited animation is easily achieved based on speaking. We investigate the level of avatar enfacement, that is believing that a picture of a face is one's own face, with three levels of facial animation: (i) one in which the facial expressions of the avatars are static, (ii) one in which we implement lip-sync motion and (iii) one in which the avatar presents lip-sync plus additional facial animations, with blinks, designed by a professional animator. We measure self-identification using a face morphing tool that morphs from the face of the participant to the face of a gender matched avatar. We find that self-identification on avatars can be increased through pre-baked animations even when these are not photorealistic nor look like the participant.},

As online social spaces evolve towards more embodied digital representations, it is important to understand how users construct and experience their self and interact with others' self in new and more complicated ways, as it may introduce new opportunities and unseen social consequences. Using findings of an interview study (N=30), in this paper we report an in-depth empirical investigation of the presentation and perception of self in Social Virtual Reality (VR) - 3D virtual spaces where multiple users can interact with one another through VR head-mounted displays and full-body tracked avatars. This study contributes to the growing body of CSCW literature on social VR by offering empirical evidence of how social VR platforms afford new phenomena and approaches of novel identity practices and by providing potential design implications to further support such practices. We also expand the existing research agenda in CSCW on the increasing complexity of people's self-presentation in emerging novel sociotechnical systems.},

	abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that allows for digitally generated three-dimensional representations to be integrated with real environmental stimuli. AR can make use of smart phones, tablets, or other devices to achieve a highly stimulating learning environment and hands-on immersive experience. The use of AR in industry is becoming widespread with applications being developed for use not just for entertainment and gaming but also healthcare, retail and marketing, education, military, travel and tourism, automotive industry, manufacturing, architecture, and engineering. Due to the distinct learning advantages that AR offers, such as remote learning and interactive simulations, AR-based teaching programs are also increasingly being adopted within medical schools across the world. These advantages are further highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an even greater shift towards online learning. In this review, we investigate the use of AR in medical training/education and its effect on students’ experiences and learning outcomes. This includes the main goals of AR-based learning, such as to simplify the delivery and enhance the comprehension of complex information. We also describe how AR can enhance the experiences of medical students, by improving knowledge and understanding, practical skills and social skills. These concepts are discussed within the context of specific AR medical training programs, such as HoloHuman, OculAR SIM, and HoloPatient. Finally, we discuss the challenges of AR in learning and teaching and propose future directions for the use of this technology in medical education.},

	abstract = {Background Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that produces a virtual manifestation of the real world. In recent years, VR has been increasingly used as a tool in medical education. The use of VR in medical education has large potential, as it allows for distance learning and training which may be challenging to deliver in real life. VR encompasses different tools and applications. There is a need to explore how VR has been employed in medical education to date.
Objective The objective of this scoping review is to conceptualise the VR tools available and the applications of VR in undergraduate medical education as reported in the literature. This scoping review will identify any gaps in this field and provide suggestions for future research.
Methods and analysis The relevant studies will be examined using the Joanna Briggs Institute methodological framework for scoping studies. A comprehensive search from a total of six electronic databases and grey literature sources will be performed. The reference list of included studies will be screened for additional studies. The screening and data extraction will be done in parallel and independently by two review authors. Any discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or discussion with a third review author. A data extraction form has been developed using key themes from the research questions. The extracted data will be qualitatively analysed and presented in a diagrammatic or tabular form, alongside a narrative summary, in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis: extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines.
Ethics and dissemination All data will be collected from published and grey literature. Ethics approval is therefore not a requirement. We will present our findings at relevant conferences and submit them for publications in peer-reviewed journals.},

A systematic search, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, was therefore carried out to explore the state of the art in emotion regulation interventions for wellbeing using virtual reality. The literature on this topic was queried, 414 papers were screened, and 11 studies were included, covering adults and older adults. Our findings offer an overview of the current use of VR technologies for the enhancement of emotion regulation (ER) and wellbeing. The results are promising and suggest that VR-based emotion regulation training can facilitate the promotion of wellbeing. An overview of VR-based training interventions is crucial for better understanding how to use these tools in the clinical settings. This review offers a critical debate on the structure of such intervention protocols. It also analyzes and highlights the crucial role played by the selection of the objective and subjective wellbeing assessment measures of said intervention protocols.},

	abstract = {The December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in China has led to worldwide quarantine, as recommended by local governments and the World Health Organization. Particularly affected are older adults (i.e., those aged ≥ 65 years) who are at elevated risk for various adverse health outcomes, including declines in motor ability and physical activity (PA) participation, increased obesity, impaired cognition, and various psychological disorders. Thus, given the secular increases in the older adult population, novel and effective intervention strategies are necessary to improve physical activity behaviors and health in this population. Virtual reality (VR)-integrated exercise is a promising intervention strategy, which has been utilized in healthcare fields like stroke rehabilitation and psychotherapy. Therefore, the purpose of this editorial is to synthesize recent research examining the efficacy and effectiveness of VR exercise in the promotion of favorable health outcomes among the older adults. Results indicate the application of VR exercise to facilitate improved physical outcomes (e.g., enhanced motor ability, reduced obesity), cognition and psychological outcomes. VR exercise has also been observed to be an effective intervention strategy for fall prevention in this population. Future research should employ more rigorous research designs to allow for a more robust quantitative synthesis of the effect of VR exercise on the preceding outcomes to elucidate which type(s) of VR-based PA interventions are most effective in promoting improved health outcomes among older adults. Findings from this study will better inform the development of technology-savvy PA programs for wellness promotion in older adults who practice social distancing and exercise from home under the unprecedented global health crisis.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is a potentially powerful technology for enhancing assessment
in mental health. At any time or place, individuals can be transported into immersive
and interactive virtual worlds that are fully controlled by the researcher or clinician.
This capability is central to recent interest in how VR might be harnessed in both
treatment and assessment of mental health conditions. The current review provides a
summary of the advantages of using VR for assessment in mental health, focusing on
increasing ecological validity of highly controlled environments, enhancing
personalization and engagement, and capturing real-time, automated data in real-world
contexts. Considerations for the implementation of VR in research and clinical settings
are discussed, including current issues with cost and access, developing evidence base,
technical challenges, and ethical implications. The opportunities and challenges of VR
are important to understand as researchers and clinicians look to harness this
technology to improve mental health outcomes.},

	abstract = {The need for remote delivery of mental health interventions including instruction in meditation has become paramount in the wake of the current global pandemic. However, the support one may usually feel within the physical presence of an instructor may be weakened when interventions are delivered remotely, potentially impacting one’s meditative experiences. Use of head-mounted displays (HMD) to display video-recorded instruction may increase one’s sense of psychological presence with the instructor as compared to presentation via regular flatscreen (e.g., laptop) monitor. This research therefore evaluated a didactic, trauma-informed care approach to instruction in mindfulness meditation by comparing meditative responses to an instructor-guided meditation when delivered face-to-face vs. by pre-recorded 360° videos viewed either on a standard flatscreen monitor (2D format) or via HMD (i.e., virtual reality [VR] headset; 3D format).},

Virtual reality (VR) may reduce initial difficulty of engaging in mindfulness exercises and increase participants’ engagement through immersion and presence.AimThe aim was to investigate how VR affects participants’ experience of engagement with mindfulness practice, and its impact on quality of practice and negative mood states.MethodsFifty-one healthcare professionals were randomized to receive either a visualization or non-visualization mindfulness practice, to compare the quality of practice through the use of audio only vs. with a virtual reality interface. Selected self-reported measures were collected during the session (immersion, quality and difficulty of practice, mood states and likelihood for future practice).ResultsResults showed that order instead of type of modality administered made a difference in quality of mindfulness practice. A greater sense of presence was reported with VR if administered after audio (F = 4.810, p = 0.033, Partial η2 = 0.093). Further, participants described difficulty practicing with audio if administered after VR (F = 4.136, p = 0.048, Partial η2 = 0.081). Additionally, lower mood disturbance was reported with VR if administered after audio (F = 8.116, p = 0.006, Partial η2 = 0.147). Qualitative responses echoed a preference for VR to engage better, in addition to improved mood states after practice.ConclusionFindings suggest that VR has the potential to provide healthcare professionals with an alternative or a supplement to conventional mindfulness practice.},

Here, we examined the modulation of a visuo-haptic illusion of touch on a virtual stick in virtual reality, when participants were embodied in an avatar and when they were not. During the experiments participants (n = 49) received successions of three taps delivered from two independent controllers while they saw visual stimuli presented sequentially along the virtual stick. The stimulation pattern resulted in a robust illusion of tapping directly on the virtual stick. After each trial, participants were asked to report where they perceived the taps. We found that participants in both the body and no-body conditions displaced the second tap toward the center of the stick, and reported similar levels of certainty about their reported location. However, the illusion of touch on the stick, as measured by the reported location of the tap, was significantly stronger for those who had a virtual body than those who did not. Therefore, our study shows that avatar embodiment can change haptic perception.},

Here, we compare recognition of emotions from spontaneous expressions with that of matched posed stimuli. Participants made forced-choice judgments about the expressed emotion and whether the expression was spontaneous, and rated expressions on intensity (Experiments 1 and 2) and prototypicality (Experiment 2). Listeners were able to accurately infer emotions from both posed and spontaneous expressions, from auditory, visual, and audiovisual cues. Furthermore, perceived intensity and prototypicality were found to play a role in the accurate recognition of emotion, particularly from spontaneous expressions. Our findings demonstrate that perceivers can reliably recognise emotions from spontaneous expressions, and that depending on the comparison set, recognition levels can even be equivalent to that of posed stimulus sets.},

This phenomenon is known as uncanny valley. The goal of this study was to identify the realism level and magnitude of facial expression that produce the maximum amount of emotional intensity and the minimum amount of perceived strangeness. We studied the perceived intensity of emotion and perceived strangeness of faces with varying levels of realism (from schematic to photorealistic) and magnitude of facial expressions (from neutral to extremely exaggerated). We found that less realistic faces required more exaggeration to reach the emotional intensity of a real human face. While there is a range of emotional intensity that can be expressed by real human faces (from neutral to full intensity), we found that the same range of emotional intensity could be expressed by artificial faces when exaggeration was used. However, attempts to express emotional intensities outside this range using exaggeration led to strange-looking faces at all levels of realism.},

A literature search was undertaken using specific electronic databases, specific journals and websites, hand searches, specific library catalogues, and electronic publishing databases. Walker and Avant's method of concept analysis was used to analyze the sources included in the analysis. All aspects of the method of Walker and Avant were covered in this concept analysis. The conceptual understanding has become more focused, the defining attributes, influencing factors and consequences are described and empirical referents identified. The concept analysis is a first step in the development of a middle-range descriptive theory of sensory overload based on social scientific and stress-theoretical approaches.

	abstract = {The field of autism studies is a highly disputed territory within which competing contradictory discourses abound. In this field, it is the voices and claims of autistic people regarding their own expertise in knowledge production concerning autism that is most recent in the debate, and traditionally the least attended to. In this article, I utilise the theories of Harry Collins and colleagues in order to reflect upon and conceptualise the various claims to knowledge production and expertise within the field of autism studies, from the perspective of an author who has been diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum. The notion that autistic people lack sociality is problematised, with the suggestion that autistic people are not well described by notions such as the ‘social brain’, or as possessing ‘zero degrees of cognitive empathy’. I then argue, however, that there is a qualitative difference in autistic sociality, and question to what extent such differences are of a biological or cultural nature, and to what extent interactional expertise can be gained by both parties in interactions between autistic and non-autistic people. In conclusion, I argue that autistic people have often become distrustful of researchers and their aims, and are frequently frozen out of the processes of knowledge production. Such a context results in a negative feedback spiral with further damage to the growth of interactional expertise between researchers and autistic people, and a breakdown in trust and communication leading to an increase in tension between stakeholder groups. The involvement of autistic scholars in research and improvements in participatory methods can thus be seen as a requirement, if social research in the field of autism is to claim ethical and epistemological integrity.},

Using an online survey, we assessed autism knowledge and stigma among 636 adults with varied relationships to autism, including autistic people and nuclear family members. Autistic participants exhibited more scientifically based knowledge than others. They were more likely to describe autism experientially or as a neutral difference, and more often opposed the medical model. Autistic participants and family members reported lower stigma. Greater endorsement of the importance of normalizing autistic people was associated with heightened stigma. Findings suggest that autistic adults should be considered autism experts and involved as partners in autism research.},

Person-first language is based on the premise that everyone, regardless of whether they have a disability, is a person-first, and therefore everyone should be referred to with person-first language. However, my analysis of scholarly writing suggests that person-first language is used more frequently to refer to children with disabilities than to refer to children without disabilities; person-first language is more frequently used to refer to children with disabilities than adults with disabilities; and person-first language is most frequently used to refer to children with the most stigmatized disabilities. Therefore, the use of person-first language in scholarly writing may actually accentuate stigma rather than attenuate it. Recommendations are forwarded for language use that may reduce stigma.},

This paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach This paper explores the development of the PARC network, reflecting upon its activities and ethos within current higher education practices and structures. Findings In supporting autistic individuals in their attempts to establish themselves within academic systems that may not always be considerate or accommodating, the existence of PARC creates a structure with which autistic people can influence social change. PARC serves as a network of support, strengthening the presence of autistic scholars in academia. It also provides a structure through which autistic people are able to demonstrate helpful practices with which to engage more broadly. Originality/value The PARC network is the first autistic-led venture of its kind in the UK to have a sustained impact. PARC is growing to become an important element in the field of autism studies both by supporting emerging autistic academics and by promoting ethical and participatory research methods and practices.},

In our review, we will examine VR use in autism research as an illustrative example to demonstrate a need for precise definitions. Three databases were chosen: Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar. 42 studies were analysed. Recommendations for future research have emerged from the reviewed literature, such as the need for larger sample sizes representing the entire autism spectrum and wider age ranges. The most substantial problem in the literature reviewed is the problem of definitions of VR. We describe the need for clear definitions of the equipment used and propose more refined terminology.},

	abstract = {Purpose Global and local processing is part of human perceptual organisation, where global processing helps extract the “gist” of the visual information and local processing helps perceive the details. Individual differences in these two types of visual processing have been found in autism and ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Virtual reality (VR) has become a more available method of research in the last few decades. No previous research has investigated perceptual differences using this technology. Design/methodology/approach The objective of the research is to threefold: (1) identify if there is association between ADHD and autistic traits and the performance on the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) task, (2) investigate practical effects of using VR drawing tools for research on perceptual experiences and (3) explore any perceptual differences brought out by the three-dimensional nature of the VR. The standard ROCF test was used as a baseline task to investigate the practical utility of using VR as an experimental platform. A total of 94 participants were tested. Findings Attention-to-detail, attention switching and imagination subscales of autism quotient (AQ) questionnaire were found to be predictors of organisational ROCF scores, whereas only the attention-to-detail subscale was predictive of perceptual ROCF scores. Originality/value The current study is an example of how classic psychological paradigms can be transferred into the virtual world. Further investigation of the distinct individual preferences in drawing tasks in VR could lead to a better understanding of individual differences in the processing of visuospatial information.},

	abstract = {Across four studies, two controlled lab experiments and two field studies, we tested the efficacy of immersive Virtual Reality (VR) as an education medium for teaching the consequences of climate change, particularly ocean acidification. Over 270 participants from four different learning settings experienced an immersive underwater world designed to show the process and effects of rising sea water acidity. In all of our investigations, after experiencing immersive VR people demonstrated knowledge gains or inquisitiveness about climate science and in some cases, displayed more positive attitudes toward the environment after comparing pre- and post-test assessments. The analyses also revealed a potential post-hoc mechanism for the learning effects, as the more that people explored the spatial learning environment, the more they demonstrated a change in knowledge about ocean acidification. This work is unique by showing distinct learning gains or an interest in learning across a variety of participants (high school, college students, adults), measures (learning gain scores, tracking data about movement in the virtual world, qualitative responses from classroom teachers), and content (multiple versions varying in length and content about climate change were tested). Our findings explicate the opportunity to use immersive VR for environmental education and to drive information-seeking about important social issues such as climate change.},

Heightened interconnection with nature elicited greater perceptions of imminence of the environmental risk and involvement with nature, which persisted for 1 week.

	abstract = {Being environmentally literate is essential to building a sustainable relationship with the environment and to understanding the threat posed by pressing issues such as climate change. However, environmental literacy is challenging because it encompasses many complex dimensions. Moreover, there is often a gap in understanding the connections between individual actions and their consequences on the environment. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) could be a promising tool to address these challenges. This chapter reviews 13 papers addressing the use of IVR to promote environmental literacy and accounts for the current state of research in this field. It highlights gaps in knowledge that need to be filled if we want to leverage the potential of IVR to contribute to one of the most pressing challenges of our society, namely environmental issues.},

	abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) systems offer a powerful tool for human behavior research. The ability to create three-dimensional visual scenes and to measure responses to the visual stimuli enables the behavioral researcher to test hypotheses in a manner and scale that were previously unfeasible. For example, a researcher wanting to understand interceptive timing behavior might wish to violate Newtonian mechanics so that objects can move in novel 3-D trajectories. The same researcher might wish to collect such data with hundreds of participants outside the laboratory, and the use of a VR headset makes this a realistic proposition. The difficulty facing the researcher is that sophisticated 3-D graphics engines (e.g., Unity) have been created for game designers rather than behavioral scientists. To overcome this barrier, we have created a set of tools and programming syntaxes that allow logical encoding of the common experimental features required by the behavioral scientist. The Unity Experiment Framework (UXF) allows researchers to readily implement several forms of data collection and provides them with the ability to easily modify independent variables. UXF does not offer any stimulus presentation features, so the full power of the Unity game engine can be exploited. We use a case study experiment, measuring postural sway in response to an oscillating virtual room, to show that UXF can replicate and advance upon behavioral research paradigms. We show that UXF can simplify and speed up the development of VR experiments created in commercial gaming software and facilitate the efficient acquisition of large quantities of behavioral research data.},

	abstract = {Individuals with high trait anxiety tend to be worse at flexibly adapting goal-directed behavior to meet changing demands relative to those with low trait anxiety. Past research on anxiety and cognitive flexibility has used tasks that involve overcoming a recently acquired rule, strategy, or response pattern after an abrupt change in task requirements (e.g., choice X led to positive outcomes but now leads to negative outcomes). An important limitation of this research is that many decision making situations require overcoming a preexisting bias (e.g., deciding whether to withdraw a historically winning investment that has experienced recent losses). In the present study we examined whether anxiety differences in the ability to overcome an acquired response extend to the ability to overcome a preexisting bias, when the bias produces objectively disadvantageous decisions. High anxiety (n = 78) and low anxiety participants (n = 76) completed a commonly used measure of cognitive flexibility, reversal learning, and a novel Framed Gambling Task that assessed the extent to which they could make advantageous decisions when the normatively correct choice was inconsistent with a preexisting framing bias. High anxiety participants showed the expected diminished reversal learning performance and also had poorer ability to make advantageous choices that were inconsistent with the framing bias. Worse performance in the Framed Gambling Task was not driven by poor knowledge of risk contingencies, because high anxiety participants reported the same explicit knowledge as low anxiety participants. Instead, the results suggest high anxiety is associated with general deficits in resolving interference from prepotent responses.},

More recently, experimental tasks such as analogue (cued) recall, combined with analysis methods including Bayesian hypothesis testing and formal model comparison, have shed new light on the properties of WM. A significant new perspective is that noise in neural representation limits the precision of recall, and several recent models incorporate this view to account for failures of binding in WM.

	abstract = {Background
Sex differences in the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disorders are particularly evident in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Heterogeneous symptom presentation and the potential of measurement bias hinder early ASD detection in females, and may contribute to discrepant prevalence estimates. We examined trajectories of social communication (SC) and restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) in a sample of infant siblings of autistic children, adjusting for age- and sex-based measurement bias. We hypothesized that leveraging a prospective elevated familial likelihood sample, deriving data-driven behavioral constructs, and accounting for measurement bias would reveal less discrepant sex ratios than are typically seen in ASD.
Methods
We conducted direct assessments of ASD symptoms at 6-9, 12-15, 24, and 36-60 months of age (total Nobservations=1254) with infant siblings of autistic children (N=377) and a lower ASD-familial-likelihood comparison group (N=168; Nobservations=527). We established measurement invariance across age and sex for separate models of SC and RRB. We then conducted latent class growth mixture modeling with the longitudinal data and evaluated for sex differences in trajectory membership.
Results
We identified two latent classes in the SC and RRB models with equal sex ratios in the high-concern cluster for both SC and RRB. Sex differences were also observed in the SC high-concern cluster, indicating that girls classified as “elevated social concerns” demonstrate milder symptoms than boys in this group.
Conclusions
This novel approach for characterizing ASD symptom progression highlights the utility of assessing and adjusting for sex-related measurement bias and identifying sex-specific patterns of symptom emergence.},

Utilizing QoL indicators as the standard for developing treatments and evaluating outcomes in autism is advantageous. After a brief description of the domains and indicators comprising QoL, this paper reviews the literature describing the course of autism, followed by an examination of indicators which contribute to QoL for people with autism in particular.

	abstract = {Business companies are increasingly aware that the world where they operate in is facing increasing environmental, economic and social challenges, thus there is a trend in most companies to align their processes and services with a sustainability agenda. Customers, shareholders, financial partners, governmental agencies, NGOs, globalization and internationalization of environmental and social standards exert new pressures on them to do so. Industry is widely recognized as being essential for wealth creation and development, although it is at times considered a source of environmental degradation and social concerns. Thus, industry must play an important role for the transition towards the sustainable society and a better future, as it is such an important social actor These factors, combined with genuine self-commitment have led to important contributions from the business sector to the development of sustainable energy and transport infrastructures, and in designing and implementing new sustainable technologies. This paper proposes Augmented Reality (AR) applications as a pertinent solution to the challenges that organizations face in their transition towards sustainability. AR allows companies to improve the efficiency of the product development, shorten the manufacturing and delivery times at a cost which is compatible with the demand. By using AR team members with different skills and roles from a product development team can view and interact with the required digital content without having to develop new specialized skills or purchase new software or hardware.},

This paper aims to systematically review the knowledge emerging from the literature at the intersection between Circular Economy and the EEE supply chain, with a special focus on enablers, levers, and their potential environmental, economic and social benefits. An original framework is developed to categorise Circular Economy enablers, levers and potential benefits. Companies in the EEE industry aiming to implement Circular Economy can exploit several enablers (grouped into digitalization, government intervention, and users’ active role) and levers (grouped into circular product design, servitised business models, and supply chain management) to generate economic, environmental and social benefits. Based on the framework, 115 articles were scrutinised. The analysis led to the definition of a research agenda, with policy and industry implications. To advance Circular Economy research in the EEE supply chain, future studies should address: (i) the enabling role of digitalization, particularly within blockchain, 3D Printing, augmented and virtual reality; (ii) design strategies focused on ‘reduce’; (iii) servitised business models based on result-oriented offerings; (iv) collaboration in the EEE supply chain; (v) the assessment of social and economic benefits to users. Future research should also investigate the systemic interrelations between enablers, levers and benefits.},

Using virtual reality environments and a dedicated virtual app providing opportunities for the public to learn more about drone usage, participants were confronted with drone surveillance at either a business area, at a park, or during an event, and received transparent information on drone usage or a neutral message proving no information on drone usage. Additionally, participants could obtain more information on drone usage by clicking on one or more information buttons in the app. Results show that, compared to an event, participants were less acceptant of drones in a business area and even less so at the park. Further analyses indicated that heightened transparency perceptions resulted in higher levels of trust, perceived control, and drone acceptance. Finally, participants particularly sought information on how drones are used in the business area and park environment, whereas a need for privacy information stood out in the park context. These findings testify to the importance of careful consideration of the environmental context and related communication needs people have when informing the public about drone usage.},

By conducting a systematic literature review on VR/AR research in tourism, this work seeks to answer five main research questions: (1) Which tourism sectors and contexts have VR and AR research emerged in?; (2) Which forms of VR and AR have garnered the most attention in tourism research?; (3 and 4) What methodologies/theories are being utilized to research VR and AR in tourism?; and (5) What are the research gaps in VR and AR tourism research? From a synthesis of 46 manuscripts, marketing and tourism education emerged as the most common contexts. However, issues with heterogeneity appeared in terminology usage alongside a lack of theory-based research in VR and AR. Also, gaps were identified where challenges identified revolved around awareness of the technology, usability, and time commitment.},

	abstract = {The current and future challenges of sustainable development require a massive transformation of habits and behaviors in the whole society at many levels. This demands a change of perspectives, priorities, and practices that can only result from the development of more aware, informed, and instructed communities and individuals. The field of design for sustainable behavior is answering this need through the development of products, systems, and services to support the change of people’s habits and decision-making processes. In this regard, Virtual Reality (VR) is a promising tool: it has already been explored to drive sustainable behavior change in several situations, through a wide range of devices, technologies, and modalities. This variety provides uncountable opportunities to designers, but it comes with a series of ethical, psychological, and technical questions. Hence, VR developers should be able to distinguish and identify possible strategies, delivering suitable solutions for each case study. In this work, we present a framework for the development of VR experiences to support sustainable behavior change, based on a systematic review. We consider the various features to manage and possible alternatives when creating a VR experience, linking them to the behavioral aspects that can be addressed according to the project’s aim. The framework will provide designers with a tool to explore and orient themselves towards possible sets of optimal choices generating tailored solutions.},

Using a 2‐index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)‐based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker‐Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML‐based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true‐population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2‐index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true‐population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML‐based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true‐population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

	abstract = {Background
Autistic people tend to report poorer Quality of Life (QOL) than comparison groups, though some studies do report more optimistic findings. Higher autistic traits are also related to poorer QOL. However, the role of alexithymia in this relationship has not been explored.
Method
A total of 163 participants (N = 53 autistic and N = 111 comparison) consented to take part; however, 30 participants were excluded due to missing data (who did not differ from those who were retained on age, gender, education, employment, or living status), leaving a final sample of 133 (N = 42 Autistic and 91 Comparison participants). Demographic information (including age, gender) was collected, alongside self-report measures of autistic traits, mental health, alexithymia, and QOL. We estimated regression models based on pre-registered analysis, and we conducted exploratory network analyses.
Results
Alexithymic traits did not predict QOL when controlling for covariates. Depression significantly predicted Physical, Psychological, and Social QOL. When examining the impact of just alexithymic traits and autistic traits, both were significantly associated with Physical and Psychological QOL. For participants with a low depression score, the correlation between alexithymia and QOL was strong; suggesting that depression occludes the association between alexithymia and QOL. Network analyses suggested that depression and anxiety exert direct effects on Physical and Psychological QOL, whereas alexithymia scores may influence Physical QOL via autistic traits.
Conclusion
In sum, depression is a pervasive negative predictor of multiple QOL domains. The role of alexithymia in predicting QOL dimensionally and categorically was not ruled out, given our exploratory analyses, we suggest that interventions which target alexithymia may positively impact QOL for those who score low on depressive symptoms.},

We searched bibliographic databases and other literature to identify studies using a direct measure of quality of life of adults on the autism spectrum. Hand searching of reference lists, citation searching and personal communication with field experts were also undertaken. In total, 827 studies were identified; 14 were included. Only one quality of life measure designed for use with the general autism spectrum population was identified. Quality of life of adults on the autism spectrum is lower than that of typically developing adults, when measured with tools designed for the general population. There are no comprehensive autism spectrum disorder–specific quality of life measurement tools validated for use with representative samples of adults on the autism spectrum. There is a pressing need to develop robust measures of quality of life of autistic adults.},

Because sensory information forms the building blocks for higher-order social and cognitive functions, we argue that sensory processing is not only an additional piece of the puzzle, but rather a critical cornerstone for characterizing and understanding ASD. In this review we discuss what is currently known about sensory processing in ASD, how sensory function fits within contemporary models of ASD, and what is understood about the differences in the underlying neural processing of sensory and social communication observed between individuals with and without ASD. In addition to highlighting the sensory features associated with ASD, we also emphasize the importance of multisensory processing in building perceptual and cognitive representations, and how deficits in multisensory integration may also be a core characteristic of ASD.},

The term `metaverse' has been coined to further facilitate the digital transformation in every aspect of our physical lives. At the core of the metaverse stands the vision of an immersive Internet as a gigantic, unified, persistent, and shared realm. While the metaverse may seem futuristic, catalysed by emerging technologies such as Extended Reality, 5G, and Artificial Intelligence, the digital `big bang' of our cyberspace is not far away. This survey paper presents the first effort to offer a comprehensive framework that examines the latest metaverse development under the dimensions of state-of-the-art technologies and metaverse ecosystems, and illustrates the possibility of the digital `big bang'. First, technologies are the enablers that drive the transition from the current Internet to the metaverse. We thus examine eight enabling technologies rigorously - Extended Reality, User Interactivity (Human-Computer Interaction), Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Computer Vision, IoT and Robotics, Edge and Cloud computing, and Future Mobile Networks. In terms of applications, the metaverse ecosystem allows human users to live and play within a self-sustaining, persistent, and shared realm. Therefore, we discuss six user-centric factors -- Avatar, Content Creation, Virtual Economy, Social Acceptability, Security and Privacy, and Trust and Accountability. Finally, we propose a concrete research agenda for the development of the metaverse.},

	abstract = {Purpose Recent work could further improve the use of VR technology by advocating the use of psychological theories in task design and highlighting certain properties of VR configurations and human – VR interactions. The variety of VR technology used in the trials prevents us from establishing a systematic relationship between the technology type and its effectiveness. As such, more research is needed to study this link, and our piece is an attempt to shed a spotlight on the issue. Design/methodology/approach To explore recent developments in the field, the authors followed the procedures of scoping review by Savickaite et al. (2022) and included publications from 2021 to 2022. Findings In this updated analysis, it was clear that the research themes emerging over the last two years were similar to those identified previously. Social training and intervention work still dominates the research area, in spite of recent calls from the autism community to broaden the scientific understanding of neurodivergent experiences and daily living behaviours. Although, autism is often characterised by difficulties with social interactions, it is just one part of the presentation. Sensory differences, motor difficulties and repetitive behaviours are also important facets of the condition, as well as various wider aspects of health, wellbeing and quality of life. However, many of these topics appear to be understudied in research on VR applications for autism. Originality/value VR stands out from other representational technologies because of its immersion, presence and interactivity and has grown into its own niche. The question of what constitutes a truly immersive experience has resurfaced. We can no longer deny that VR has established itself in autism research. As the number of studies continues to grow, it is a perfect time to reconsider and update our notion of definitions of immersion and its reliance on hardware.},

This includes exploring why it is important to meaningfully include neurodivergent groups and the benefits their inclusion provide. Design/methodology/approach VR is becoming increasingly widespread as a consumer product and interventional tool. It is vital for researchers and developers to embrace best practices in these early stages of using the technology, making certain that neurodivergent people have the best possible outcomes. Findings The neurodivergent community is dissatisfied with many of the research directions currently being undertaken. This dissatisfaction arises from conflicting priorities between different stakeholders and the lack of input from the community. Participatory research brings neurodivergent people into the research process, whether as members of the research team or as consultants at key steps. Effective participatory research ensures that the priorities of the neurodivergent community are better incorporated in research, as well as enabling the development of more effective applications for VR. Originality/value Participatory methods are unutilised in the development of applications aimed for neurodivergent people. By describing their use and utility in other areas, this article aims to encourage other VR researchers to take neurodivergent people on board.},

However, initial work on the relationship between VR and disability suggests that VR is a body-centric technology that poses barriers for disabled users. We supplement this work with a theoretical analysis of immersive VR through the lens of Surrogate Body theory, a concept from media theory for the structured examination of interactive media in use. Leveraging Critical Disability Studies, particularly the theory of the Minority Body, we explore the assumptions about bodies inherent in VR, and we refect on implications of these assumptions when disabled people engage with the technology. Our fndings show that VR is an inherently ableist technology that assumes a ‘corporeal standard’ (i.e., an ‘ideal’, non-disabled human body), and fails to adequately accommodate disabled people. We conclude with implications for HCI research on VR, and discuss design approaches that foster inclusive technology development.},

	abstract = {Background: Rates of anxiety are inordinately high in autistic adults. Sensory reactivity differences, such as hyperreactivity (e.g., strong reactions to sound), hyporeactivity (e.g., no, or slower reactions to pain), and seeking (e.g., fascination with spinning objects), are a diagnostic criterion of autism and have been linked with anxiety. Understanding how individuals perceive these to be causally related can impact the assessment and treatment of anxiety. Therefore, we examined the perceived causal relations (PCR) between sensory reactivity differences and anxiety in autistic adults. Method: Two hundred forty-six autistic adults aged 18–76 years took part in an online study. They completed self-report assessments of sensory reactivity differences, and anxiety, followed by the PCR scale, indicating whether they perceived their sensory reactivity differences to be more of a cause or an effect of their anxiety symptoms. Results: We found sensory reactivity hyperreactivity, hyporeactivity, and seeking to be significantly correlated with anxiety. Further, we found total sensory hyperreactivity, and visual, auditory, and olfactory hyperreactivity, to be perceived as significantly more of a cause of anxiety than an effect, and total sensory seeking, and tactile and vestibular seeking, to be perceived as significantly more of an effect of anxiety than a cause. Conclusion: Future individualized approaches to treating anxiety in autistic individuals may benefit from differentiating between potential sensory causes of anxiety (e.g. hypersensitivities) vs. potential sensory effects of anxiety (e.g. sensory seeking behaviors).},

Following a thematic synthesis procedure, this metasynthesis aimed to explore specifically the lived experience of these sensory features. Four databases were systematically searched for qualitative studies describing sensory issues reported by autistic individuals. Article quality was assessed with the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme. Thematic analysis was used to identify and synthesise key themes. The 32 articles included reported data from 430 participants. Data analysis produced two themes structuring the sensory experiences of autistic people: (1) the everyday experience through body, thoughts and emotions, and (2) the relational experience, relationships being experienced as both a problem and a solution. Four dimensions are found in our results: physical, emotional, relational and social. Whereas a scientific approach to the sensory experience of autistic people is based on a cause–effect model, our results suggest that autistic people experience these dimensions holistically, as inseparable, and not in terms of cause and effect. This original finding brings new research perspectives, beyond the dichotomy between sensory features and social communications issues, and concrete implications within the health care system to provide more effective and respectful care to autistic people.},

Based on converging evidence that autistic children may benefit from having control, we tested 41 autistic children (8 female) aged 4–12 years (mean = 8 years, standard deviation = 2.05 years) who used the Multi-Sensory Environment both with and without control over the sensory changes. Behavioural coding of video data showed that having control was associated with increased attention and reduced repetitive motor behaviours, sensory behaviours, activity levels, stereotyped speech and vocalisations. Social behaviour, anxiety, positive affect and arousal were not significantly affected by condition. Our findings demonstrate that how a Multi-Sensory Environment is used can affect autistic children’s behaviours.

	abstract = {From the perspectives of grounded, situated, and embodied cognition, we have developed a new approach for assessing individual differences.  Because this approach is grounded in two dimensions of situatedness—situational experience and the Situated Action Cycle—we refer to it as the Situated Assessment Method (SAM2).  Rather than abstracting over situations during assessment of a construct (as in traditional assessment instruments), SAM2 assesses a construct in situations where it occurs, simultaneously measuring factors from the Situated Action Cycle known to influence it.  To demonstrate this framework, we developed the SAM2 Habitual Behavior Instrument (SAM2 HBI).  Across three studies with a total of 442 participants, the SAM2 HBI produced a robust and replicable pattern of results at both the group and individual levels.  Three trait-level measures of behavior regularity across 80 behaviors, 40 positive behaviors, and 40 negative behaviors exhibited large reliable individual differences.  Several sources of evidence demonstrated the construct validity of these measures.  At both the group and individual levels, the SAM2 measure of behavior regularity was associated with factors from the Situated Action Cycle known to influence habitual behavior in the literature (consistency, automaticity, immediate reward, long-term reward).  Regressions explained approximately 65\% of the variance at the group level and a median of approximately 75\% at the individual level.  The SAM2 measure of behavior regularity also exhibited well-established interactions with personality measures for self-control and neuroticism.  Cognitive-affective processes from the Situated Action Cycle explained nearly all the variance in these interactions.  Finally, a composite measure of habitualness established habitual behaviors at both the group and individual levels.  Additionally, a composite measure of reward was strongly related to the composite measure of habitualness, increasing with self-control and decreasing with neuroticism.},

For children with ASD, the Short Sensory Profile scores Underresponsive/Seeks Sensation and Auditory Filtering explained 47\% of the variance in academic performance, yet estimated intelligence was not a significant predictor of academic performance. Significant negative correlations were found between (1) auditory filtering and inattention to cognitive tasks, (2) tactile hypersensitivity and hyperactivity and inattention, and (3) movement sensitivity and oppositional behavior.CONCLUSION. A pattern of auditory filtering difficulties, sensory underresponsiveness, and sensory seeking was associated with academic underachievement in the children with ASD. Children who have difficulty processing verbal instructions in noisy environments and who often focus on sensory-seeking behaviors appear more likely to underachieve academically.},

The present study found converging evidence of this remarkable ability using a broad range of actions with whole-body movements. In addition, we found that individuals with a high degree of autistic traits showed worse performance in identifying own-body movements, particularly for simple actions. A Bayesian analysis showed that action complexity modulates the relationship between autistic traits and self-recognition performance. These findings reveal the impact of autistic traits on the ability to represent and recognize own-body movements.},

We report a study in which a crossed-hands illusion was investigated in autistic children. Neurotypical individuals often experience a subjective reversal of temporal order judgments when their hands are stimulated while crossed and the illusion is known to be acquired in early childhood. However, under those conditions where the somatotopic representation is given priority over the actual spatial location of the hands, such reversals may not occur. Here, we showed that a significantly smaller illusory reversal was demonstrated in autistic children than in neurotypical children. Furthermore, in an additional experiment, the young boys who had higher Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) scores generally showed a smaller crossed hands deficit. These results suggest that rudimentary spatio-temporal processing of tactile stimuli exists in autistic children and the altered processing may interfere with the development of an external frame of reference in real-life situations.},

	abstract = {Autistic people report difficulties with the demands of a neurotypical world, but little research has assessed the impact of the environment on such difficulties. We investigated the effect of ambient sounds on decision-making and heart rate variability. Adults without intellectual disability were allocated to autistic (n?=?38) or neurotypical (n?=?37) groups matched on age, intellectual functioning and self-reported gender. Participants completed a shopping decision-making task in three randomly ordered sound conditions: no sound, non-social shopping sound (e.g. fridges humming) and social shopping sound (e.g. people talking). Decision-making latency, decision-making consistency, and heart rate variability were measured. Participants also provided qualitative reports of their experiences. Qualitative analyses indicated that autistic participants experienced (1) the non-social and social sound conditions more negatively than the no sound condition and (2) the social sound condition more negatively than neurotypical participants. However, there were no statistically significant differences in decision-making latency, decision-making consistency, or heart rate variability across sound conditions and participant groups. Further research should consider alternative quantitative measures to explore subjective experience to help understand further which aspects of the environment autistic people are sensitive to, in turn, enabling more evidence-based autism-friendly changes to be made.Lay abstractMany autistic people report difficulties making decisions during everyday tasks, such as shopping. To examine the effect of sounds on decision-making, we developed a supermarket task where people watched a film shown from the shopper?s perspective and were asked to make decisions between different products. The task was divided into three sections and participants completed each section in a different auditory environment: (1) no sounds, (2) non-social sounds (e.g. fridges humming) and (3) social sounds (e.g. people talking). Thirty-eight autistic and 37 neurotypical adults took part. We measured decision-making by examining how long it took to make a decision and how consistent people were with their decisions. We also measured heart rate variability because this biological response provides a measure of anxiety. After the supermarket shopping task, participants told us in their own words about their experiences. Autistic participants said that they found the non-social and social sound conditions more difficult than the no sound condition, and autistic participants found the social sound condition more negative than neurotypical participants. However, decision-making and heart rate variability were similar for autistic and neurotypical participants across the sound conditions, suggesting that these measures may not have been sensitive enough to reflect the experiences the autistic participants reported. Further research should consider alternative measures to explore the experiences reported by autistic people to help us understand which specific aspects of the environment autistic people are sensitive to. This, in turn, may enable more specific and evidence-based autism-friendly changes to be made.},

	abstract = {Background: Although the proper use of hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount for preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, health care personnel have been shown to use incorrect techniques for donning/doffing of PPE and hand hygiene, leading to a large number of infections among health professionals. Education and training are difficult owing to the social distancing restrictions in place, shortages of PPE and testing material, and lack of evidence on optimal training. Virtual reality (VR) simulation can offer a multisensory, 3-D, fully immersive, and safe training opportunity that addresses these obstacles.
Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the short- and long-term effectiveness of a fully immersive VR simulation versus a traditional learning method regarding a COVID-19–related skill set and media-specific variables influencing training outcomes.
Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study on medical students (N=29; intervention VR training, n=15, vs control video-based instruction, n=14) to compare the performance of hand disinfection, nasopharyngeal swab taking, and donning/doffing of PPE before and after training and 1 month later as well as variables of media use.
Results: Both groups performed significantly better after training, with the effect sustained over one month. After training, the VR group performed significantly better in taking a nasopharyngeal swab, scoring a median of 14 out of 17 points (IQR 13-15) versus 12 out of 17 points (IQR 11-14) in the control group, P=.03. With good immersion and tolerability of the VR simulation, satisfaction was significantly higher in the VR group compared to the control group (median score of User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire 27/30, IQR 23-28, vs 22/30, IQR 20-24, in the control group; P=.01).
Conclusions: VR simulation was at least as effective as traditional learning methods in training medical students while providing benefits regarding user satisfaction. These results add to the growing body of evidence that VR is a useful tool for acquiring simple and complex clinical skills.},

	abstract = {Background
Virtual Reality (VR) simulation has been a topic of interest in recent years as an innovative strategy for healthcare education. Although there are a handful of studies evaluating VR simulation on knowledge, motivation, and satisfaction; there is a paucity of evidence to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability and usability of ‘Immersive’ VR (IVR) simulation in nursing students.
Objectives
A two-stage sequential mixed-methods feasibility study underpinned by gaming theory investigated; (1) the impact of IVR sepsis game on pre-registration nurses' self-efficacy and, (2) their perceptions of the acceptability and applicability of IVR sepsis game as an adjunct to nursing simulation education.
Methods
The IVR simulation intervention was designed in collaboration with serious game specialists. Stage one collated pre and post-intervention self-efficacy scores with 19 pre-registration nurses using the validated instrument, Nursing Anxiety and Self-Confidence with Clinical Decision Making (NASC-CDM©) scale. Stage two used a descriptive qualitative approach to explore student nurses' perceptions of the game.
Results
In stage one, pre and post-test scores revealed significant increase in self-confidence (26.1\%, P {\textless} 0.001) and a significant decrease in anxiety (23.4\%, P {\textless} 0.001). Stage two qualitative responses revealed four over-arching themes: acceptability, applicability, areas of improvement of IVR sepsis game and limitations of IVR game.
Conclusion
IVR simulation show promise as an adjunct for nurse simulation and it appears to increase self-efficacy in pre-registration nursing students. Further testing with a sufficiently powered sample size will ratify findings and provide effective solutions to distance and online learning.},

	abstract = {Background: The purpose of this study was to develop a mobile head mounted display (HMD)-based virtual reality (VR) nursing education program (VRP), and to evaluate the effects on knowledge, learning attitude, satisfaction with self-practice, and learning motivation in nursing students. Methods: This was a quasi-experimental study using a nonequivalent control group pretest-posttest design to evaluate the effects of HMD-based VRP on nursing students. A Chemoport insertion surgery nursing scenario was developed with HMD-based VRP. The experimental group consisting of 30 nursing students underwent pre-debriefing, followed by VRP using HMD and debriefing. The control group, consisting of 30 nursing students, underwent pre-debriefing, followed by self-learning using handouts about Chemoport insertion surgery procedures for 30 min, and debriefing. Results: The experimental group that underwent HMD-based VRP showed significantly improved post-intervention knowledge on operating nursing (p = 0.001), learning attitude (p = 0.002), and satisfaction (p = 0.017) compared to the control group. Sub-domains of motivation, attention (p {\textless} 0.05), and relevance (p {\textless} 0.05) were significantly different between the two groups, post-intervention. Conclusions: HMD-based VRP of Chemoport insertion surgery is expected to contribute to knowledge, learning attitude, satisfaction, attention, and relevance in nursing students.},

	abstract = {Individuals’ conceptual knowledge of contemporary biological issues influences ethical attitudes and life decisions around health, as evidenced by the recent worldwide debate on vaccinations. The reasons for which the public opinion is so critically divided can be partially explained from the didactic approaches used in biology education. In view of the rapid evolution of Virtual Reality (VR) as well as the increasing interest that youths have shown toward Escape Rooms (ER), an unexplored research and development avenue is identified. In this experimental study, we present the design and development steps as well as the evaluation of a VRER dedicated to biology education. For comparison purposes, an educational instructional video utilising the storytelling technique was also prepared. Both approaches were examined in the upper secondary education context with participants (N = 50) emerging from the Applied Sciences academic path. The key-findings suggest that the active learning approach leads to increased knowledge acquisition, in the short term, as opposed to the passive learning approach but no significant differences were identified in the long term (knowledge retention) across the methods. Based on the instructional decisions made and the key-findings emerged we provide implications and guidelines for the design, development, and integration of VRER in education.},

The HMD group scored significantly higher than the video group on presence (d = 1.43), enjoyment (d = 1.10), interest (d = .57), and retention in an immediate (d = .61) and delayed posttest (d = .70). A structural equation model indicated that enjoyment mediated the pathway from instructional media to immediate posttest, and interest mediated the pathway from instructional media to delayed posttest score, indicating that these factors may play different roles in the learning process with immersive media. This work contributes to the cognitive affective model of immersive learning, and suggests that immersive lessons can have positive longitudinal effects for learning.},

	abstract = {Background
Recent challenges to nurse education have resulted in an increased use of virtual reality which serves as an immersive and effective medium for skill and knowledge acquisition. Virtual reality technology is being included in nurse curricula at undergraduate level. This technology remains a relatively new experience for many nursing students with limited evidence regarding students' perspectives regarding virtual reality.
Objective
To explore nursing students' perspectives of incorporating virtual reality in nurse education.
Design
Qualitative descriptive study using thematic analysis.
Setting
Public university in Ireland.
Participants
Undergraduate nursing students were recruited using purposive and snowball sampling.
Methods
Students (n = 26) participated in face-to-face semi-structured individual interviews and focus groups in January and February 2020. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.
Results
Three themes were constructed from the interviews: captivating, innovative, and empowering nature of virtual reality; contextual transfer; and challenges and threats to actualisation. Participants believed that virtual reality affords a novel, fun, memorable, inclusive, and engaging means of learning. Many believed that virtual reality would complement current teaching and learning approaches, help build learners' confidence, and provide nursing students with a safe space for trial, error, and problem-solving. The use of virtual reality was recommended to practise various nursing skills and learn about human anatomy, physiology, problem-solving, and clinical decision-making. Participants identified the resources incurred by the technology as challenges to implementing virtual reality in nurse education and stressed the need for continuous face-to-face feedback.
Conclusions
Findings suggest that virtual reality technology has the potential to facilitate learning, complement current educational approaches, and provide nurse educators with novel and engaging means of content delivery.},

The majority of studies were focused on describing and evaluating the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the applied instructional design processes using various VR applications to disseminate their findings on user experience, usability issues, students’ outcomes, and/or learning performance. This study contributes by reviewing how instructional design strategies and techniques can potentially benefit students’ learning performance using a wide range of VR applications. It also proposes some recommendations to guide and lead effective instructional design settings in several teaching and learning contexts to outline a more accurate and up-to-date picture of the current state of literature.},

	doi = {10.2196/23708},
	abstract = {Background: In southeastern Appalachian Ohio, the prevalence of diabetes is 19.9\%, nearly double that of the national average of 10.5\%.  Here, people with diabetes are more likely to have a delayed diagnosis, limited access to health care, and lower health literacy. Despite the high rates of diabetes in the region, the availability of endocrinologists and certified diabetes care and education specialists is limited. Therefore, innovative strategies to address the growing diabetes care demands are needed. One approach is to train the primary care workforce in new and emerging therapies for type 2 diabetes to meet the increasing demands and complexity of diabetes care.
Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a virtual reality training program designed to improve cultural self-efficacy and diabetes attitudes.
Methods: Health care providers and administrators were recruited from large health care systems, private practices, university-owned hospitals or clinics, Federally Qualified Health Centers, local health departments, and AmeriCorps. Providers and administrators participated in a 3-hour virtual reality training program consisting of 360-degree videos produced in a professional, cinematic manner; this technique is called virtual reality cinema (cine-VR). Questionnaires measuring cultural self-efficacy, diabetes attitudes, and presence in cine-VR were administered to providers and administrators before and after the program.
Results: A total of 69 participants completed the study. The mean age of the sample was 42.2 years (SD 13.7), 86\% (59/69) identified as female, 83\% (57/69) identified as White, 86\% (59/69) identified as providers, and 25\% (17/69) identified as nurses. Following the training program, we observed positive improvements in all three of the cultural self-efficacy subscales: Cognitive (mean change –1.29; t65=–9.309; P\&lt;.001), Practical (mean change –1.85; t65=–9.319; P\&lt;.001), and Affective (mean change –0.75; t65=–7.067; P\&lt;.001). We observed the largest magnitude of change with the subscale, with a Cohen d of 1.16 indicating a very large effect. In addition, we observed positive improvements in all five of the diabetes attitude subscales: Need for special training (mean change –0.21; t67=–6.154; P\&lt;.001), Seriousness of type 2 diabetes (mean change –0.34; t67=–8.114; P\&lt;.001), Value of tight glucose control (mean change –0.13; t67=–3.029; P=.001), Psychosocial impact of diabetes (mean change –0.33; t67=–6.610; P\&lt;.001), and Attitude toward patient autonomy (mean change –0.17; t67=–3.889; P\&lt;.001). We observed the largest magnitude of change with the Psychosocial impact of diabetes subscale, with a Cohen d of 0.87 indicating a large effect. We observed only one significant correlation between presence in cine-VR (ie, Interface Quality) and a positive change score (ie, Affective self-efficacy) (r=.285; P=.03).
Conclusions: Our findings support the notion that cine-VR education is an innovative approach to improve cultural self-efficacy and diabetes attitudes among health care providers and administrators. The long-term impact of cine-VR education on cultural self-efficacy and diabetes attitudes needs to be determined.},

Four core categories emerged: turbulent sensory perceptual experiences, coping mechanisms, enjoyable sensory perceptual experiences, and awareness of being different, suggesting that people with autism experience both distress and enjoyment from their sensory perceptual experiences. The use of specific coping mechanisms enabled the person to deal with the distress or difficulties experienced and helped the person derive some enjoyment from the experience. Some of these people were aware that their sensory perceptual experiences were different from non-autistic individuals, but this did not decrease the enjoyment derived from some of their sensory perceptual experiences. These sensory perceptual experiences form an integral part of the individual’s biographical embodied sense of self, and probably of autism.},

	abstract = {?Stereotyped or repetitive motor movements? are characterised as core features in the diagnosis of autism, yet many autistic adults (and the neurodiversity movement) have reclaimed them as ?stimming?. Supported by a growing body of scientific research, autistic adults argue that these behaviours may serve as useful coping mechanisms, yet little research has examined stimming from the perspective of autistic adults. Through interviews and focus groups, we asked 32 autistic adults to share their perceptions and experiences of stimming, including the reasons they stim, any value doing so may hold for them and their perceptions of others? reactions to stimming. Using thematic analysis, we identified two themes: stimming as (1) a self-regulatory mechanism and (2) lacking in social acceptance, but can become accepted through understanding. Autistic adults highlighted the importance of stimming as an adaptive mechanism that helps them to soothe or communicate intense emotions or thoughts and thus objected to treatment that aims to eliminate the behaviour.},

The main objectives of this study were to determine the consequences of adding immersive VR to virtual learning simulations, and to investigate whether the principles of multimedia learning generalize to immersive VR. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) was used to obtain a direct measure of cognitive processing during learning. A sample of 52 university students participated in a 2 × 2 experimental cross-panel design wherein students learned from a science simulation via a desktop display (PC) or a head-mounted display (VR); and the simulations contained on-screen text or on-screen text with narration. Across both text versions, students reported being more present in the VR condition (d = 1.30); but they learned less (d = 0.80), and had significantly higher cognitive load based on the EEG measure (d = 0.59). In spite of its motivating properties (as reflected in presence ratings), learning science in VR may overload and distract the learner (as reflected in EEG measures of cognitive load), resulting in less opportunity to build learning outcomes (as reflected in poorer learning outcome test performance).},

Experiment 2 showed that asking students to summarize segments of the immersive virtual reality lesson increased their learning outcomes without diminishing their motivation and interest. Taken together, the 2 experiments showed that students’ interest can be primed with new and exciting technology while still being an effective medium to convey scientific information comparable to traditional PowerPoint slideshow lessons.},

The review follows a three-stage analysis on VR technologies, applications and future directions through a systematic analysis. It is found that the VR technologies adopted for CEET evolve over time, from desktop-based VR, immersive VR, 3D game-based VR, to Building Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled VR. A sibling technology, Augmented Reality (AR), for CEET adoptions has also emerged in recent years. These technologies have been applied in architecture and design visualization, construction health and safety training, equipment and operational task training, as well as structural analysis. Future research directions, including the integration of VR with emerging education paradigms and visualization technologies, have also been provided. The findings are useful for both researchers and educators to usefully integrate VR in their education and training programs to improve the training performance.},

We also investigate how the level of immersion impacts perceived learning outcomes using structural equation modeling. The sample consisted of 104 university students (39 females). Significantly higher scores were obtained on 11 of the 13 variables investigated using the immersive VR version of the simulation, with the largest differences occurring with regard to presence and motivation. Furthermore, we identified a model with two general paths by which immersion in VR impacts perceived learning outcomes. Specifically, we discovered an affective path in which immersion predicted presence and positive emotions, and a cognitive path in which immersion fostered a positive cognitive value of the task in line with the control value theory of achievement emotions.},

We assessed effects on knowledge gain, and different self-reported measures (self-efficacy, engagement, presence). Unlike previous studies of display type that measured effects only immediately after the VR experience, we considered also a longer time span (2 weeks). Results indicated that the display type played a significant role in engagement and presence. The training benefits (increased knowledge and self-efficacy) were instead obtained, and maintained at two weeks, regardless of the display used.

	abstract = {Background: Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that allows the user to explore and manipulate computer-generated real or artificial three-dimensional multimedia sensory environments in real time to gain practical knowledge that can be used in clinical practice. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of VR for educating health professionals and improving their knowledge, cognitive skills, attitudes, and satisfaction. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the effectiveness of VR in pre- and postregistration health professions education following the gold standard Cochrane methodology. We searched 7 databases from the year 1990 to August 2017. No language restrictions were applied. We included randomized controlled trials and cluster-randomized trials. We independently selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias, and then, we compared the information in pairs. We contacted authors of the studies for additional information if necessary. All pooled analyses were based on random-effects models. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to rate the quality of the body of evidence. Results: A total of 31 studies (2407 participants) were included. Meta-analysis of 8 studies found that VR slightly improves postintervention knowledge scores when compared with traditional learning (standardized mean difference [SMD]=0.44; 95\% CI 0.18-0.69; I2=49\%; 603 participants; moderate certainty evidence) or other types of digital education such as online or offline digital education (SMD=0.43; 95\% CI 0.07-0.79; I2=78\%; 608 participants [8 studies]; low certainty evidence). Another meta-analysis of 4 studies found that VR improves health professionals’ cognitive skills when compared with traditional learning (SMD=1.12; 95\% CI 0.81-1.43; I2=0\%; 235 participants; large effect size; moderate certainty evidence). Two studies compared the effect of VR with other forms of digital education on skills, favoring the VR group (SMD=0.5; 95\% CI 0.32-0.69; I2=0\%; 467 participants; moderate effect size; low certainty evidence). The findings for attitudes and satisfaction were mixed and inconclusive. None of the studies reported any patient-related outcomes, behavior change, as well as unintended or adverse effects of VR. Overall, the certainty of evidence according to the GRADE criteria ranged from low to moderate. We downgraded our certainty of evidence primarily because of the risk of bias and/or inconsistency. Conclusions: We found evidence suggesting that VR improves postintervention knowledge and skills outcomes of health professionals when compared with traditional education or other types of digital education such as online or offline digital education. The findings on other outcomes are limited. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of immersive and interactive forms of VR and evaluate other outcomes such as attitude, satisfaction, cost-effectiveness, and clinical practice or behavior change.},

There are separate reviews of VR technologies and serious games for educational and training purposes with a focus on only one knowledge area. However, this review covers 135 proposals for serious games in immersive VR-environments that are combinations of both VR and serious games and that offer end-user validation. First, an analysis of the forum, nationality, and date of publication of the articles is conducted. Then, the application domains, the target audience, the design of the game and its technological implementation, the performance evaluation procedure, and the results are analyzed. The aim here is to identify the factual standards of the proposed solutions and the differences between training and learning applications. Finally, the study lays the basis for future research lines that will develop serious games in immersive VR-environments, providing recommendations for the improvement of these tools and their successful application for the enhancement of both learning and training tasks.},

The Corner Cave System (CCS) is compared with the Head Mounted Display (HMD) system. Both of these systems are using a tracking system to reflect the user movements in the virtual environment. The CCS uses only three coordinates: x-, y- and z-axis. The HMD system has six degrees of freedom, the x-, y- and z-axis, as well as the roll, pitch and yaw. Those two systems are also compared with HMD, as a standalone device (HMD-SA) without the tracking system where it has only roll, pitch and yaw. The objective of the study was to evaluate the impact of VR systems on the students’ achievements in engineering colleges. The research examined the effect of the four different methods and compared the scores of the students after each test. The experiments were ran over 48 students.

Simulation is increasingly becoming a cornerstone of clinical training and, though effective, is resource intensive. With increasing pressures on budgets and standardisation, virtual reality (VR) is emerging as a new method of delivering simulation. VR offers benefits for learners and educators, delivering cost-effective, repeatable, standardised clinical training on demand. A large body of evidence supports VR simulation in all industries, including healthcare. Though VR is not a panacea, it is a powerful educational tool for defined learning objectives and implementation is growing worldwide. The future of VR lies in its ongoing integration into curricula and with technological developments that allow shared simulated clinical experiences. This will facilitate quality interprofessional education at scale, independent of geography, and transform how we deliver education to the clinicians of the future.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Frontline health professionals need a “red flag” tool to aid their decision making about whether to make a referral for a full diagnostic assessment for an autism spectrum condition (ASC) in children and adults. The aim was to identify 10 items on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) (Adult, Adolescent, and Child versions) and on the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT) with good test accuracy. Method: A case sample of more than 1,000 individuals with ASC (449 adults, 162 adolescents, 432 children and 126 toddlers) and a control sample of 3,000 controls (838 adults, 475 adolescents, 940 children, and 754 toddlers) with no ASC diagnosis participated. Case participants were recruited from the Autism Research Centre's database of volunteers. The control samples were recruited through a variety of sources. Participants completed full-length versions of the measures. The 10 best items were selected on each instrument to produce short versions. Results: At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 adult, sensitivity was 0.88, specificity was 0.91, and positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.85. At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 adolescent, sensitivity was 0.93, specificity was 0.95, and PPV was 0.86. At a cut-point of 6 on the AQ-10 child, sensitivity was 0.95, specificity was 0.97, and PPV was 0.94. At a cut-point of 3 on the Q-CHAT-10, sensitivity was 0.91, specificity was 0.89, and PPV was 0.58. Internal consistency was {\textgreater}0.85 on all measures.

	abstract = {Some autistic people employ strategies and behaviours to cope with the everyday social world, thereby ‘camouflaging’ their autistic differences and difficulties. This review aimed to systematically appraise and synthesise the current evidence base pertaining to autistic camouflaging. Following a systematic search of eight databases, 29 studies quantifying camouflaging in children and adults with autism diagnoses or high levels of autistic traits were reviewed. The multiple methods used to measure camouflaging broadly fell under two different approaches: internal-external discrepancy or self-report. These approaches appear to relate to two distinct but potentially connected elements of camouflaging: observable behavioural presentations and self-perceived camouflaging efforts. While significant variation was noted across individual study findings, much of the existing literature supported three preliminary findings about the nature of autistic camouflaging: (1) adults with more self-reported autistic traits report greater engagement in camouflaging; (2) sex and gender differences exist in camouflaging; and (3) higher self-reported camouflaging is associated with worse mental health outcomes. However, the research base was limited regarding participant characterisation and representativeness, which suggests that conclusions cannot be applied to the autistic community as a whole. We propose priorities for future research in refining the current understanding of camouflaging and improving measurement methods.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the relationship between Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) via their impact on sensory processing (SP), which previous simple correlational analysis suggests is affected in both. We examined adults from the general population without clinical diagnoses, using a broad-based self-report survey methodology, looking at the symptoms of ADHD and ASD, SP and a range of other issues (anxiety, reward sensitivity and schizotypy) which are reliant on sensory processing. Their relationship was explored using Exploratory Graph Analysis, a method which assesses whether survey responses cluster into 'communities'. We found three communities, reflecting typical inter and intrapersonal ADHD/ASD problems. Although ADHD/ASD did not form a community with sensory processing, the model suggested ADHD/ASD are connected to sensory processing through intermediary conditions, such as panic anxiety. The model suggested that disorganised thought, speech and behaviour, and challenges in social interaction, use anxiety as a bridge with sensory processing, through aberrant attentional deployment and biases in cognitive processes, which can induce anxious states and therefore manifest in behaviour typical of ADHD/ASD. Previous simple correlational analyses overestimate the direct relationship between ADHD/ASD and sensory processing changes.},

	abstract = {Sensory features (i.e., atypical responses to sensory stimuli) are included in the current diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorder. Yet, large population-based studies have not examined these features. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of sensory features among autistic children, and examine associations between sensory features, demographics, and co-occurring problems in other areas. Analysis for this study included a sample comprised of 25,627 four- or eight-year-old autistic children identified through the multistate Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network (2006–2014). We calculated the prevalence of sensory features and applied multilevel logistic regression modeling. The majority (74\%; 95\% confidence interval: 73.5\%–74.5\%) of the children studied had documented sensory features. In a multivariable model, children who were male and those whose mothers had more years of education had higher odds of documented sensory features. Children from several racial and ethnic minority groups had lower odds of documented sensory features than White, non-Hispanic children. Cognitive problems were not significantly related to sensory features. Problems related to adaptive behavior, emotional states, aggression, attention, fear, motor development, eating, and sleeping were associated with higher odds of having documented sensory features. Results from a large, population-based sample indicate a high prevalence of sensory features in autistic children, as well as relationships between sensory features and co-occurring problems. This study also pointed to potential disparities in the identification of sensory features, which should be examined in future research. Disparities should also be considered clinically to avoid reduced access to supports for sensory features and related functional problems. Lay Summary In a large, population-based sample of 25,627 autistic children, 74\% had documented differences in how they respond to sensation. We also identified significant associations of sensory features with adaptive behavior and problems in other domains. Sensory features were less common among girls, children of color, and children of mothers with fewer years of education, suggesting potential disparities in identification.},

Other possible explanations for mental health problems among autistic populations have received little attention. As evidenced by the minority disability movement, autism is increasingly being considered part of the identities of autistic people. Autistic individuals thus constitute an identity-based minority and may be exposed to excess social stress as a result of disadvantaged and stigmatized social status. The authors test the utility of the minority stress model as an explanation for the experience of mental health problems within a sample of high-functioning autistic individuals (n = 111). Minority stressors including everyday discrimination, internalized stigma, and concealment significantly predicted poorer mental health, despite controlling for general stress exposure. These results indicate the potential utility of minority stress in explaining increased mental health problems in autistic populations. Implications for research and clinical applications are discussed.},

We report that anxiety disorders are common in individuals with ASD and overall prevalence rates for anxiety disorders as an aggregate group range between 42\% and 79\%. The prevalence rates for individual anxiety disorders are variable. Specific phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and social anxiety disorder are the most common but the rate and type of anxiety disorders may vary across age and ability level. Challenges in measuring anxiety in ASD and factors that may contribute to variation in overall rates and those for specific disorders are discussed. The objective of summarizing the research literature on anxiety in ASD to date is to set out clear guidelines for the future direction of research and also interpret the findings to highlight the key clinical implications.},

However, literature on the applicability of this theory to the auditory domain is limited and, in many cases, inconsistent. Here we present a novel “auditory search task” that allows systematic investigation of the impact of auditory load on auditory conscious perception. An array of simultaneous, spatially separated sounds was presented to participants. On half the trials, a critical stimulus was presented concurrently with the array. Participants were asked to detect which of 2 possible targets was present in the array (primary task), and whether the critical stimulus was present or absent (secondary task). Increasing the auditory load of the primary task (raising the number of sounds in the array) consistently reduced the ability to detect the critical stimulus. This indicates that, at least in certain situations, load theory applies in the auditory domain. The implications of this finding are discussed both with respect to our understanding of typical audition and for populations with altered auditory processing.

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has an intriguing auditory processing profile. Individuals show enhanced pitch discrimination, yet often find seemingly innocuous sounds distressing. This study used two behavioural experiments to examine whether an increased capacity for processing sounds in ASD could underlie both the difficulties and enhanced abilities found in the auditory domain. Autistic and non-autistic young adults performed a set of auditory detection and identification tasks designed to tax processing capacity and establish the extent of perceptual capacity in each population. Tasks were constructed to highlight both the benefits and disadvantages of increased capacity. Autistic people were better at detecting additional unexpected and expected sounds (increased distraction and superior performance respectively). This suggests that they have increased auditory perceptual capacity relative to non-autistic people. This increased capacity may offer an explanation for the auditory superiorities seen in autism (e.g. heightened pitch detection). Somewhat counter-intuitively, this same ‘skill’ could result in the sensory overload that is often reported – which subsequently can interfere with social communication. Reframing autistic perceptual processing in terms of increased capacity, rather than a filtering deficit or inability to maintain focus, increases our understanding of this complex condition, and has important practical implications that could be used to develop intervention programs to minimise the distress that is often seen in response to sensory stimuli.},

Here we examine this diversity using two methods – a survey of researchers (n = 163) and a quasi-systematic review of papers using LMMs (n = 400). The survey reveals substantive concerns among psychologists using or planning to use LMMs and an absence of agreed standards. The review of papers complements the survey, showing variation in how the models are built, how effects are evaluated and, most worryingly, how models are reported. Using these data as our departure point, we present a set of best practice guidance, focusing on the reporting of LMMs. It is the authors’ intention that the paper supports a step-change in the reporting of LMMs across the psychological sciences, preventing a trajectory in which findings reported today cannot be transparently understood and used tomorrow.},

	abstract = {The ability to remain focused on goal-relevant stimuli in the presence of potentially interfering distractors is crucial for any coherent cognitive function. However, simply instructing people to ignore goal-irrelevant stimuli is not sufficient for preventing their processing. Recent research reveals that distractor processing depends critically on the level and type of load involved in the processing of goal-relevant information. Whereas high perceptual load can eliminate distractor processing, high load on ‘frontal’ cognitive control processes increases distractor processing. These findings provide a resolution to the long-standing early and late selection debate within a load theory of attention that accommodates behavioural and neuroimaging data within a framework that integrates attention research with executive function.},

	abstract = {Objective: Previous studies examining selective attention in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have yielded conflicting results, some suggesting superior focused attention (e.g., on visual search tasks), others demonstrating greater distractibility. This pattern could be accounted for by the proposal (derived by applying the Load theory of attention, e.g., Lavie, 2005) that ASD is characterized by an increased perceptual capacity (Remington, Swettenham, Campbell, \& Coleman, 2009). Recent studies in the visual domain support this proposal. Here we hypothesize that ASD involves an enhanced perceptual capacity that also operates across sensory modalities, and test this prediction, for the first time using a signal detection paradigm. Method: Seventeen neurotypical (NT) and 15 ASD adolescents performed a visual search task under varying levels of visual perceptual load while simultaneously detecting presence/absence of an auditory tone embedded in noise. Results: Detection sensitivity (d′) for the auditory stimulus was similarly high for both groups in the low visual perceptual load condition (e.g., 2 items: p = .391, d = 0.31, 95\% confidence interval [CI] [−0.39, 1.00]). However, at a higher level of visual load, auditory d′ reduced for the NT group but not the ASD group, leading to a group difference (p = .002, d = 1.2, 95\% CI [0.44, 1.96]). As predicted, when visual perceptual load was highest, both groups then showed a similarly low auditory d′ (p = .9, d = 0.05, 95\% CI [−0.65, 0.74]). Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that increased perceptual capacity in ASD operates across modalities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

In a study of neurotypical participants (n = 179), we utilized a brief flanker interference task while varying the perceptual load of the visual display.

We show that individuals who score above average on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) show stronger interference at high perceptual load than individuals with below-average AQ scores. This is consistent with recent findings in individuals with autism spectrum conditions, and supports the idea that the cognitive style of the autistic brain is reflected in a broader phenotype across the population.},

Fourteen adults with ASD and 23 adults without ASD performed a selective attention task with varying perceptual loads. Compared with the non-ASD group, the ASD group required higher levels of perceptual load to successfully ignore irrelevant distractors; moreover, the ASD group did not show any general reduction in performance speed or accuracy.

	abstract = {Selective attention allows us to ignore what is task-irrelevant and focus on what is task-relevant. The cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie this process are key topics of investigation in cognitive psychology. One of the more prominent theories of attention is perceptual load theory, which suggests that the efficiency of selective attention is dependent on both perceptual and cognitive load. It is now more than 20 years since the proposal of load theory, and it is a good time to evaluate the evidence in support of this influential model. The present article supplements and extends previous reviews (Lavie, Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 9, 75–82. doi:10.1016/j.tics.2004.12.004, 2005, Current Directions in Psychological Science, 19, 143–148. doi:10.1177/0963721410370295, 2010) by examining more recent research in what appears to be a rapidly expanding area. The article comprises five parts, examining (1) evidence for the effects of perceptual load on attention, (2) cognitive load, (3) individual differences under load, (4) alternative theories and criticisms, and (5) the future of load theory. We argue that the key next step for load theory will be the application of the model to real-world tasks. The potential benefits of applied attention research are numerous, and there is tentative evidence that applied research would provide strong support for the theory itself, as well as real-world benefits related to activities in which attention is crucial, such as driving and education.},

	abstract = {Background. A self-report screening scale of adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the World Health Organization (WHO) Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) was developed in conjunction with revision of the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The current report presents data on concordance of the ASRS and of a short-form ASRS screener with blind clinical diagnoses in a community sample.Method. The ASRS includes 18 questions about frequency of recent DSM-IV Criterion A symptoms of adult ADHD. The ASRS screener consists of six out of these 18 questions that were selected based on stepwise logistic regression to optimize concordance with the clinical classification. ASRS responses were compared to blind clinical ratings of DSM-IV adult ADHD in a sample of 154 respondents who previously participated in the US National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R), oversampling those who reported childhood ADHD and adult persistence.Results. Each ASRS symptom measure was significantly related to the comparable clinical symptom rating, but varied substantially in concordance (Cohen's κ in the range 0·16–0·81). Optimal scoring to predict clinical syndrome classifications was to sum unweighted dichotomous responses across all 18 ASRS questions. However, because of the wide variation in symptom-level concordance, the unweighted six-question ASRS screener outperformed the unweighted 18-question ASRS in sensitivity (68·7\% v. 56·3\%), specificity (99·5\% v. 98·3\%), total classification accuracy (97·9\% v. 96·2\%), and κ (0·76 v. 0·58).Conclusions. Clinical calibration in larger samples might show that a weighted version of the 18-question ASRS outperforms the six-question ASRS screener. Until that time, however, the unweighted screener should be preferred to the full ASRS, both in community surveys and in clinical outreach and case-finding initiatives.},

Consequently, the present study examined the relation between trait anxiety and task performance using a perceptual load task (Maylor \& Lavie, 1998). Sixty-eight male college students completed a visual search task that indexed processing of irrelevant distractors systematically across four levels of perceptual load. Results indicated that anxiety was related to difficulty suppressing the behavioural effects of irrelevant distractors (i.e., decreased reaction time efficiency) under high, but not low, perceptual loads. In contrast, anxiety was not associated with error rates on the task. These findings are consistent with the prediction that anxiety is associated with impairments in performance efficiency under conditions that tax attentional resources.},

Attentional selectivity was measured by longer reaction times in response to the incompatible than to the compatible distractors. Participants in the stress group participated in a speech test that increased anxiety and threatened self-esteem. The effect of perceptual load interacted with the stress manipulation in that participants in the control group demonstrated an interference effect under the low perceptual load condition, whereas such interference disappeared under the high perceptual load condition. Importantly, the stress group showed virtually no interference under the low perceptual load condition, whereas substantial interference occurred under the high perceptual load condition.

We made the following hypotheses based on ACT: i) anxiety-related AC deficits occur in the AC components of inhibition and switching, but not updating; ii) deficits will be more pronounced for AC efficiency (reaction times) than effectiveness (accuracy); iii) studies with high cognitive load conditions will observe greater deficits than studies with normal cognitive load; iv) age and anxiety level will moderate the effect of anxiety on AC. Fifty-eight studies (N = 8292) met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis revealed a significant AC deficit for high compared to low anxiety participants (Hedges' g = −0.58). Overall, results supported assumptions of ACT: anxiety produced significant deficits in AC efficiency but not effectiveness; these deficits occurred in inhibition and switching but not updating and studies with high cognitive load conditions found larger anxiety related AC deficits. Age moderated the relationship between anxiety and AC in behavioural studies and anxiety severity moderated this relationship in self-report studies.

The Adult Reading History Questionnaire (ARHQ) is among the most commonly used self-reported questionnaires. High ARHQ scores indicate an increased likelihood that an adult had RD as a child and that their children may develop RD. This study focused on whether a subset of ARHQ items (ARHQ-Brief) could be equally effective in assessing adults’ reading history as the full ARHQ. We used a machine learning approach, lasso (known as L1 regularization), and identified 6 of 23 items that resulted in the ARHQ-Brief. Data from 97 adults and 47 children were included. With the ARHQ-Brief, we report a threshold of 0.323 as suitable to identify past likelihood of RD in adults with a sensitivity of 72.4\% and a specificity of 81.5\%. Comparison of predictive performances between ARHQ-Brief and the full ARHQ showed that ARHQ-Brief explained an additional 10\%–35.2\% of the variance in adult and child reading. Furthermore, we validated ARHQ-Brief’s superior ability to predict reading ability using an independent sample of 28 children. We close by discussing limitations and future directions.},

	abstract = {The question of ‘what is a mental disorder?’ is central to the philosophy of psychiatry, and has crucial practical implications for psychiatric nosology. Rather than approaching the problem in terms of abstractions, we review a series of exemplars – real-world examples of problematic cases that emerged during work on and immediately after DSM-5, with the aim of developing practical guidelines for addressing future proposals. We consider cases where (1) there is harm but no clear dysfunction, (2) there is dysfunction but no clear harm, and (3) there is possible dysfunction and/or harm, but this is controversial for various reasons. We found no specific criteria to determine whether future proposals for new entities should be accepted or rejected; any such proposal will need to be assessed on its particular merits, using practical judgment. Nevertheless, several suggestions for the field emerged. First, while harm is useful for defining mental disorder, some proposed entities may require careful consideration of individual v. societal harm, as well as of societal accommodation. Second, while dysfunction is useful for defining mental disorder, the field would benefit from more sharply defined indicators of dysfunction. Third, it would be useful to incorporate evidence of diagnostic validity and clinical utility into the definition of mental disorder, and to further clarify the type and extent of data needed to support such judgments.},

Lay abstract
Anxiety disorders are common in autism. Research studies have identified factors that influence anxiety in autism, such as difficulties with uncertain situations, difficulties understanding own emotions, differences in processing sensory input (related to our senses) and difficulties regulating emotions. To date, a few studies have considered the combination of these factors within the same sample. This study used structural equation modelling to test the contribution of these factors in autism. Autistic (n = 86) and non-autistic adults (n = 100) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires. Only when applied to each group separately, the broad predictions of the model were confirmed for the autistic group. The model confirmed that difficulties with uncertain situations and in regulating emotions play a central role in anxiety in autism. Difficulties understanding own emotions and differences in processing sensory input both contribute to anxiety indirectly through their respective interrelation with the other two factors (difficulties with uncertain situations and in regulating emotions). Importantly, the results imply that sensory processing differences contribute not only indirectly but also directly to individual differences in anxiety. For the non-autistic group, model fit could only be achieved after removing autism-related traits and sensory processing differences as predictors of anxiety. These results suggest that cause/development and expression of anxiety in autism partially overlap with what is observed in the general population except that sensory processing differences appear to play a relatively unique role in the context of autism.},

	abstract = {The authors discuss what can be learned from our experience with deinstitutionalization. The deinstitutionalization of mentally ill persons has three components: the release of these individuals from hospitals into the community, their diversion from hospital admission, and the development of alternative community services. The greatest problems have been in creating adequate and accessible community resources. Where community services have been available and comprehensive, most persons with severe mental illness have significantly benefited. On the other hand, there have been unintended consequences of deinstitutionalization—a new generation of uninstitutionalized persons who have severe mental illness, who are homeless, or who have been criminalized and who present significant challenges to service systems. Among the lessons learned from deinstitutionalization are that successful deinstitutionalization involves more than simply changing the locus of care; that service planning must be tailored to the needs of each individual; that hospital care must be available for those who need it; that services must be culturally relevant; that severely mentally ill persons must be involved in their service planning; that service systems must not be restricted by preconceived ideology; and that continuity of care must be achieved.},

	abstract = {We conducted the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68\% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were extremely or very helpful for 41\% of experiments, they were minimally helpful for 9\% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32\% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67\% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41\% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication – it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.},

However, these scales are all calibrated to DSM-IV criteria, which are narrower than the recently developed DSM-5 criteria.To update for DSM-5 criteria and improve the operating characteristics of the widely used World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) for screening.Probability subsamples of participants in 2 general population surveys (2001-2003 household survey [n = 119] and 2004-2005 managed care subscriber survey [n = 218]) who completed the full 29-question self-report ASRS, with both subsamples over-sampling ASRS-screened positives, were blindly administered a semistructured research diagnostic interview for DSM-5 adult ADHD. In 2016, the Risk-Calibrated Supersparse Linear Integer Model, a novel machine-learning algorithm designed to create screening scales with optimal integer weights and limited numbers of screening questions, was applied to the pooled data to create a DSM-5 version of the ASRS screening scale. The accuracy of the new scale was then confirmed in an independent 2011-2012 clinical sample of patients seeking evaluation at the New York University Langone Medical Center Adult ADHD Program (NYU Langone) and 2015-2016 primary care controls (n = 300). Data analysis was conducted from April 4, 2016, to September 22, 2016.The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), and positive predictive value (PPV) of the revised ASRS.Of the total 637 participants, 44 (37.0\%) household survey respondents, 51 (23.4\%) managed care respondents, and 173 (57.7\%) NYU Langone respondents met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD in the semistructured diagnostic interview. Of the respondents who met DSM-5 criteria for adult ADHD, 123 were male (45.9\%); mean (SD) age was 33.1 (11.4) years. A 6-question screening scale was found to be optimal in distinguishing cases from noncases in the first 2 samples. Operating characteristics were excellent at the diagnostic threshold in the weighted (to the 8.2\% DSM-5/Adult ADHD Clinical Diagnostic Scale population prevalence) data (sensitivity, 91.4\%; specificity, 96.0\%; AUC, 0.94; PPV, 67.3\%). Operating characteristics were similar despite a much higher prevalence (57.7\%) when the scale was applied to the NYU Langone clinical sample (sensitivity, 91.9\%; specificity, 74.0\%; AUC, 0.83; PPV, 82.8\%).The new ADHD screening scale is short, easily scored, detects the vast majority of general population cases at a threshold that also has high specificity and PPV, and could be used as a screening tool in specialty treatment settings.},

A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.},

	abstract = {TOPIC: The triad of impairment referred to at present in the autism-related literature is a behavioral triad. This paper extends this thinking of the triad of impairment to the triad that underlies the behavioral manifestation. The real triad of impairment. PURPOSE: This paper considers the thinking and information processing style of autism and takes the next transitional step in understanding the triad of impairment. SOURCES USED: Contemporary literature on autism and information processing. CONCLUSIONS: Exceptional pioneering work in the late 1970s gave rise to the concept of the triad of impairments as the central plank of the construct of autism: impaired communication; impaired social skills; and a restricted and repetitive way of being-in-the-world. This clear articulation of the structures of the phenomena allowed a new way for professionals and families to see and understand autism, and to relate to those with autism. Like the evolution of many concepts, this was a transitional idea. The original triad of impairments described the behavioral manifestation; the actual triad of impairments is at the level of cognitive processing. The actual triad of impairment is static and ubiquitous unlike the variable and fluctuating behavioral manifestation. The actual triad of impairment in autism is visual as opposed to linguistic processing, impaired abstraction, and lack of theory of mind. The actual triad is central to all diagnosis that together makes up the autism spectrum.},

The variations in population-based ASD prevalence across four European countries with universal health care practices likely reflect variation in detection, referral and diagnosis practices and autism awareness across these areas.

	abstract = {Objective
To derive the first systematically calculated estimate of the relative proportion of boys and girls with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) through a meta-analysis of prevalence studies conducted since the introduction of the DSM-IV and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision.
Method
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. The Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched, and study quality was rated using a risk-of-bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. The pooled outcome measurement was the male-to-female odds ratio (MFOR), namely the odds of being male in the group with ASD compared with the non-ASD group. In effect, this is the ASD male-to-female ratio, controlling for the male-to-female ratio among participants without ASD.
Results
Fifty-four studies were analyzed, with 13,784,284 participants, of whom 53,712 had ASD (43,972 boys and 9,740 girls). The overall pooled MFOR was 4.20 (95\% CI 3.84–4.60), but there was very substantial between-study variability (I2 = 90.9\%). High-quality studies had a lower MFOR (3.32; 95\% CI 2.88–3.84). Studies that screened the general population to identify participants regardless of whether they already had an ASD diagnosis showed a lower MFOR (3.25; 95\% CI 2.93–3.62) than studies that only ascertained participants with a pre-existing ASD diagnosis (MFOR 4.56; 95\% CI 4.10–5.07).
Conclusion
Of children meeting criteria for ASD, the true male-to-female ratio is not 4:1, as is often assumed; rather, it is closer to 3:1. There appears to be a diagnostic gender bias, meaning that girls who meet criteria for ASD are at disproportionate risk of not receiving a clinical diagnosis.},

Using an online survey, we examined the perceived opposition between the medical model and the neurodiversity movement by assessing conceptions of autism and neurodiversity among people with different relations to autism. Participants (N ϭ 657) included autistic people, relatives and friends of autistic people, and people with no specified relation to autism. Self-identification as autistic and neurodiversity awareness were associated with viewing autism as a positive identity that needs no cure, suggesting core differences between the medical model and the neurodiversity movement. Nevertheless, results suggested substantial overlap between these approaches to autism. Recognition of the negative aspects of autism and endorsement of parenting practices that celebrate and ameliorate but do not eliminate autism did not differ based on relation to autism or awareness of neurodiversity. These findings suggest a deficit-as-difference conception of autism wherein neurological conditions may represent equally valid pathways within human diversity. Potential areas of common ground in research and practice regarding autism are discussed.},

Membership in this community as an autistic person largely results from clinical identification, or biocertification. However, there are many autistic individuals who diagnose themselves. This practice is contentious among autistic communities. Using data gathered from Wrong Planet, an online autism community forum, this article describes the debate about self-diagnosis amongst autistic self-advocates and argues for the acceptance of the practice in light of the difficulties in verifying autism as a ‘natural kind.’ This practice can counteract discriminatory practices towards and within the autistic community and also work to verfiy autistic self-knowledge and self-expertise. This discussion also has important implications for other neurocommunities, neuroethical issues such as identity and privacy, and the emerging field of critical autism studies.},

In all, 3470 UK residents responded to an online survey on their preferred ways of describing autism and their rationale for such preferences. The results clearly show that people use many terms to describe autism. The most highly endorsed terms were ‘autism’ and ‘on the autism spectrum’, and to a lesser extent, ‘autism spectrum disorder’, for which there was consensus across community groups. The groups disagreed, however, on the use of several terms. The term ‘autistic’ was endorsed by a large percentage of autistic adults, family members/friends and parents but by considerably fewer professionals; ‘person with autism’ was endorsed by almost half of professionals but by fewer autistic adults and parents. Qualitative analysis of an open-ended question revealed the reasons underlying respondents’ preferences. These findings demonstrate that there is no single way of describing autism that is universally accepted and preferred by the UK’s autism community and that some disagreements appear deeply entrenched.},

This qualitative study aimed to understand how autistic individuals make sense of their own autism and experience the stigma attached to autism. The study used critical grounded theory tools. Participants (N = 20) discussed autism as central to their identity, and integral to who they are. While participants thought of autism as value neutral, they expressed how society confers negative meanings onto autism, and thus, them. The findings also indicate that different understandings of autism confer different levels of stigma. Participants expressed constant exposure to stigma and managed this stigma in different ways. Such methods included reframing to more positive understandings of autism, the reclamation of language, and using concealment and disclosure strategically. The implications of these findings are discussed further in the article.Points of interestAutistic research participants consider their autism to be value neutral – akin to any other feature like race or hair colour.Participants feel that society sees their autism as being a bad trait to have.Participants struggled with the tension in how they see themselves, versus how they believe society sees them.Participants are caught between disclosing that they are autistic and concealing it, but feel they are treated negatively either way.Participants use the word “autistic” to reclaim autism from stigma, and to reframe peoples understandings of autism to be less negative.},

Evidence has suggested that atypical sensory and, particularly, olfactory processing is present in several neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). In this paper, we present data obtained by a systematic literature review, conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, regarding the possible association between olfaction and ASDs, and analyze them critically in order to evaluate the occurrence of olfactory impairment in ASDs, as well as the possible usefulness of olfactory evaluation in such conditions. The results obtained in this analysis suggested a possible involvement of olfactory impairment in ASDs, underlining the importance of olfactory evaluation in the clinical assessment of ASDs. This assessment could be potentially included as a complementary evaluation in the diagnostic protocol of the condition.

Methods: Five children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and five children with typical development (TD) participated in a 10 min vestibular swing activity and had their postural stability evaluated pre- and post-intervention under four different sensory testing conditions. Sway ranges, mean sway velocity, sway root mean square (RMS), and sample entropy were calculated from center of pressure (COP) data. Results: All five children with ASD demonstrated decreased mean sway velocity in the eyes open/flat plate condition post-intervention with an average decrease of 5.87 ± 2.69 mm/s. Four of the five children with ASD demonstrated an increase in RMS and a decrease in anterior/posterior sample entropy post-intervention in the eyes closed, foam pad condition and eyes open, flat plate condition respectively.

	abstract = {Previous studies have reported reduced quality of life in autism. Improving quality of life for autistic people is, therefore, a key priority for clinical research and practice. However, the relative impact of core autism traits (e.g. social-communication difficulties), as compared to associated mental health symptoms (e.g. anxiety, depression) on quality of life remains poorly understood. This is despite at least 20\%–50\% of autistic individuals experiencing associated anxiety and/or depression symptoms. Hence, we measured subjective quality of life in 573 six to thirty-year-olds (autism spectrum disorder N = 344), using two widely validated questionnaires. Adults self-reported on the World Health Organization Quality of Life–Brief instrument. Parents of children/adolescents completed the Child Health and Illness Profile. We assessed individual variability across both measures and modelled associations between quality of life, core autism traits, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Across both age groups and quality of life measures, autistic individuals scored lower than comparison individuals, on average, particularly for physical health in adults (d = −1.24, 95\% confidence interval: [−1.56, −0.93]) and school achievement for children/adolescents (d = −1.06, 95\% confidence interval: [−1.29, −0.84]). However, a notable proportion of autistic individuals (36\%–71\% across quality of life domains) did not have reduced quality of life. Across ages and quality of life measures, severity of associated symptoms was significantly related to reduced quality of life on several domains, after accounting for core autism traits. Most notably, depression symptoms were related to reduced physical/psychological well-being in both adults (β ⩾ −0.34) and children/adolescents (β = −0.29, 95\% confidence interval: [−0.36, −0.14]). For children/adolescents, anxiety symptoms (β ⩾ −0.28) and core social-communication difficulties (β ⩾ −0.22) were also related to subjective quality of life outcomes. Overall, findings indicate that not all autistic individuals experience reduced subjective quality of life. Variability in quality of life is significantly influenced by associated symptoms, across developmental stage. This may provide a tractable target for mental health services to improve quality of life for autistic individuals over the lifespan.
Lay abstract
Previous studies suggest that some autistic individuals report lower satisfaction, or well-being, with different aspects of everyday life than those without autism. It is unclear whether this might be partly explained by symptoms of anxiety and/or depression, which affect at least 20\%–50\% of autistic people. In this study, we measured individual differences in well-being in 573 six to thirty-year-olds with and without a diagnosis of autism. We investigated whether individual differences in well-being were explained by autism traits (e.g. social-communication difficulties) and/or anxiety and depression symptoms. We showed that, though well-being was lower for some autistic individuals, compared to those without autism, many autistic individuals reported good well-being. Where well-being was reduced, this was particularly explained by depression symptoms, across all ages. For children/adolescents, anxiety and social-communication difficulties were also related to some aspects of well-being. Our study suggests that support and services for improving mental health, especially depression symptoms, may also improve broader outcomes for autistic people.},

We discuss how specific developmental mechanisms, which reduce inhibition, affect cortical and hippocampal functions.

However, basic questions remain unanswered. Here, we review the major findings and models of perception in autism and point to methodological issues that have led to conflicting results. We show that popular models of perception in autism, such as the reduced prior hypothesis, cannot explain the many and varied findings. To resolve these issues, we point to the benefits of using rigorous psychophysical methods to study perception in autism. We advocate for perceptual models that provide a detailed explanation of behavior while also taking into account factors such as context, learning, and attention. Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of tracking changes over the course of development to reveal the causal pathways and compensatory mechanisms. We finally propose a developmental perceptual narrowing account of the condition.},

In 1878 C. R. Vulpian2 observed reflex dilation after removal of both the upper cervical and the stellate ganglion; he concluded that this dilation was mediated by sympathetic dilator fibers outside the cervical sympathetic chain. In 1883 von Bechterew3 suggested that pupillary dilation to pain stimuli might be caused by inhibition of the third nerve, rather than by impulses running over the peripheral sympathetic fibers. Braunstein4 expressed himself in favor of Bechterew's hypothesis, since, after having cut the third nerve intracranially, he could no longer obtain reflex dilation to pathic},

A fundamental objective in this area of psychophysiological research is to establish reliable biosignal indices that reveal the underlying physiological mechanisms of the stress response. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive guidelines on the relationship between the multitude of biosignal features used in the literature and their corresponding behaviour during stress, in this paper, the impact of stress to multiple bodily responses is surveyed. Emphasis is put on the efficiency, robustness and consistency of biosignal data features across the current state of knowledge in stress detection. It is also explored multimodal biosignal analysis and modelling methods for deriving accurate stress correlates.

However, there is no consensus on how to reliably measure sensory reactivity, particularly in minimally verbal individuals. The current study is an initial validation of the Sensory Assessment for Neurodevelopmental Disorders (SAND), a novel clinician-administered observation and corresponding caregiver interview that captures sensory symptoms based on DSM-5 criteria for ASD. Methods: Eighty children between the ages of 2 and 12 participated in this study; 44 children with ASD and 36 typically developing (TD) children. Sensory reactivity symptoms were measured using the SAND and the already validated Short Sensory Profile (SSP). Initial psychometric properties of the SAND were examined including reliability, validity, sensitivity and specificity. Results: Children with ASD showed significantly more sensory reactivity symptoms compared to TD children across sensory domains (visual, tactile, and auditory) and within sensory subtypes (hyperreactivity, hyporeactivity and seeking). The SAND showed strong internal consistency, inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability, high sensitivity (95.5\%) and specificity (91.7\%), and strong convergent validity with the SSP. Significance: The SAND provides a novel method to characterize sensory reactivity symptoms based on DSM-5 criteria for ASD. This is the first known sensory assessment that combines a clinician-administered observation and caregiver interview to optimally capture sensory phenotypes characteristic of individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. The SAND offers a beneficial new tool for both research and clinical purposes and has the potential to meaningfully enhance gold-standard assessment of ASD.

Several studies have suggested that they may be associated with an increased risk of mortality; however, the results are inconsistent.To assess the risk of mortality among persons with ASD or ADHD and their first-degree relatives.A search of MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO (published from inception to April 1, 2021) was supplemented by searching reference lists of the retrieved articles.Cohort and case-control studies that reported mortality rate ratios (RRs) in persons with ASD or ADHD and/or their first-degree relatives compared with the general population or those without ASD/ADHD were included.Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were performed by at least 2 researchers independently. A random-effects model was used to meta-analyze individual studies and assessed heterogeneity (I2).All-cause mortality in association with ASD or ADHD. Secondary outcome was cause-specific mortality.Twenty-seven studies were included, with a total of 642 260 individuals. All-cause mortality was found to be higher for persons with ASD (154 238 participants; 12 studies; RR, 2.37; 95\% CI, 1.97-2.85; I2, 89\%; moderate confidence) and persons with ADHD (396 488 participants; 8 studies; RR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.13-4.02; I2, 98\%; low confidence) than for the general population. Among persons with ASD, deaths from natural causes (4 studies; RR, 3.80; 95\% CI, 2.06-7.01; I2, 96\%; low confidence) and deaths from unnatural causes were increased (6 studies; RR, 2.50; 95\% CI, 1.49-4.18; I2, 95\%; low confidence). Among persons with ADHD, deaths from natural causes were not significantly increased (4 studies; RR, 1.62; 95\% CI, 0.89-2.96; I2, 88\%; low confidence), but deaths from unnatural causes were higher than expected (10 studies; RR, 2.81; 95\% CI, 1.73-4.55; I2, 92\%; low confidence).This systematic review and meta-analysis found that ASD and ADHD are associated with a significantly increased risk of mortality. Understanding the mechanisms of these associations may lead to targeted strategies to prevent avoidable deaths in high-risk groups. The substantial heterogeneity between studies should be explored further.},

	abstract = {Hyperfocus and flow are experiences of intense concentration associated with reduced perception of irrelevant stimuli and improved task performance (Ashinoff \& Abu-Akel, 2021). Historically, hyperfocus has been conceptualized as a symptom of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, or schizophrenia within the psychiatry literature, whereas flow has been construed as an enjoyable and facilitative experience within positive psychology. Recent studies (e.g., Ashinoff \& Abu-Akel, 2021) have suggested that hyperfocus and flow are the same phenomenon viewed through different lenses. The present study investigates hyperfocus and flow experiences of college students with and without clinically significant symptoms of ADHD. Eight-five undergraduate volunteers with and without ADHD completed measures of dispositional hyperfocus and flow, as well as an ADHD screening instrument. Correlations showed that most elements of hyperfocus were negatively or not correlated with most aspects of flow. Further, a MANOVA and post-hoc ANOVAs revealed that students with clinically significant levels of ADHD symptoms reported higher levels of hyperfocus and lower levels of most aspects of flow compared to students without ADHD. These results suggest either that hyperfocus and flow are distinct, inversely related constructs, or that the wording of the questionnaire items influences responders to think of their experiences of task absorption differently.},

Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are known to be at increased risk of exposure to traumas such as maltreatment and abuse, however less is known about possible susceptibility towards the development of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and associated risk factors.
Aims
This study investigated the rates of trauma exposure and PTSD, and the role of cumulative trauma exposure and memory as risk factors for PTSD in adults who self-reported having received an ASD diagnosis, compared to a typically developing (TD) comparison group.
Methods
Questionnaires assessing self-reported frequency of trauma exposure (LEC), PTSD symptomology (PCL-S) and memory (EMQ- R and BRIEF-A) were completed online by 38 ASD adults and 44 TD adults.
Results
Rates of trauma exposure and PTSD symptomatology were significantly higher in the ASD group, compared to the TD group, with deficits in working memory and everyday memory mediating this association. Interestingly, a cumulative effect of trauma exposure on PTSD symptom severity was only found in the ASD group.
Conclusions
High rates of trauma and probable PTSD in ASD adults highlight the importance of routine screening. Cumulative trauma exposure and memory deficits may act to increase risk of PTSD in ASD; longitudinal research is called for.},

It is unclear whether subsets of these traits share any underlying causality. This lack of a cohesive conceptualization of the disorder has complicated the search for broadly effective therapies, diagnostic markers, and neural/genetic correlates. In this paper, we describe how theoretical considerations and a review of empirical data lead to the hypothesis that some salient aspects of the autism phenotype may be manifestations of an underlying impairment in predictive abilities. With compromised prediction skills, an individual with autism inhabits a seemingly “magical” world wherein events occur unexpectedly and without cause. Immersion in such a capricious environment can prove overwhelming and compromise one’s ability to effectively interact with it. If validated, this hypothesis has the potential of providing unifying insights into multiple aspects of autism, with attendant benefits for improving diagnosis and therapy.},

A recent and thought-provoking article presented a normative explanation for the perceptual symptoms of autism in terms of a failure of Bayesian inference (Pellicano and Burr, 2012). In response, we suggested that when Bayesian inference is grounded in its neural instantiation—namely, predictive coding—many features of autistic perception can be attributed to aberrant precision (or beliefs about precision) within the context of hierarchical message passing in the brain (Friston et al., 2013). Here, we unpack the aberrant precision account of autism. Specifically, we consider how empirical findings—that speak directly or indirectly to neurobiological mechanisms—are consistent with the aberrant encoding of precision in autism; in particular, an imbalance of the precision ascribed to sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs.},

	abstract = {According to a recent influential proposal, several phenotypic features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be accounted for by differences in predictive skills between individuals with ASD and neurotypical individuals. In this systematic review, we describe results from 47 studies that have empirically tested this hypothesis. We assess the results based on two observable aspects of prediction: learning a pairing between an antecedent and a consequence and responding to an antecedent in a predictive manner. Taken together, these studies suggest distinct differences in both predictive learning and predictive response. Studies documenting differences in learning predictive pairings indicate challenges in detecting such relationships especially when predictive features of an antecedent have low salience or consistency, and studies showing differences in habituation and perceptual adaptation suggest low-level predictive processing differences in ASD. These challenges may account for the observed differences in the influence of predictive priors, in spontaneous predictive movement or gaze, and in social prediction. An important goal for future research will be to better define and constrain the broad domain-general hypothesis by testing multiple types of prediction within the same individuals. Additional promising avenues include studying prediction within naturalistic contexts and assessing the effect of prediction-based intervention on supporting functional outcomes for individuals with ASD. Lay Summary Researchers have suggested that many features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may be explained by differences in the prediction skills of people with ASD. We review results from 47 studies. These studies suggest that ASD may be associated with differences in the learning of predictive pairings (e.g., learning cause and effect) and in low-level predictive processing in the brain (e.g., processing repeated sounds). These findings lay the groundwork for research that can improve our understanding of ASD and inform interventions.

Researchers differentiate aspects of anxiety into state and trait, respectively defined as a more transient reaction to an adverse situation, and as a more stable personality attribute in experiencing events. It is yet unclear whether brain structural and functional features may distinguish these aspects of anxiety. To study this, we assessed 42 healthy participants with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and then investigated with MRI to characterize structural grey matter covariance and resting-state functional connectivity (rs-FC). We found several differences in the structural–functional patterns across anxiety types: (1) trait anxiety was associated to both structural covariance of Default Mode Network (DMN), with an increase in dorsal nodes and a decrease in its ventral part, and to rs-FC of DMN within frontal regions; (2) state anxiety, instead, was widely related to rs-FC of Salience Network and of DMN, specifically in its ventral nodes, but not associated with any structural pattern. In conclusion, our study provides evidence of a neuroanatomical and functional distinction between state and trait anxiety. These neural features may be additional markers in future studies evaluating early diagnosis or treatment effects.},

This approach resulted in 66 meta-analyses. The review included 175 studies published from 1980 to 2007, which yielded 851 effect sizes. For a given analysis, the number of studies ranged from three to 63 (total sample size ranged from 1,076 to 75,229). All diagnostic groups were high on neuroticism (mean Cohen's d = 1.65) and low on conscientiousness (mean d = −1.01). Many disorders also showed low extraversion, with the largest effect sizes for dysthymic disorder (d = −1.47) and social phobia (d = −1.31). Disinhibition was linked to only a few conditions, including SUD (d = 0.72). Finally, agreeableness and openness were largely unrelated to the analyzed diagnoses. Two conditions showed particularly distinct profiles: SUD, which was less related to neuroticism but more elevated on disinhibition and disagreeableness, and specific phobia, which displayed weaker links to all traits. Moderator analyses indicated that epidemiologic samples produced smaller effects than patient samples and that Eysenck's inventories showed weaker associations than NEO scales. In sum, we found that common mental disorders are strongly linked to personality and have similar trait profiles. Neuroticism was the strongest correlate across the board, but several other traits showed substantial effects independent of neuroticism. Greater attention to these constructs can significantly benefit psychopathology research and clinical practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

The chapter argues that complex acquisition procedures have the potential to model characteristics of anxiety disorders that are left unexplored by the simple acquisition procedure. Discussions revolve around, but are not limited to, five acquisition procedures or phenomena that exceed a “simple” predictive conditional stimulus or conditional stimulus (CS)–unconditional stimulus (US) relationship relationship: context conditioning, inhibitory conditioning, stimulus competition, feature-positive occasion setting, and stimulus generalization/ categorization. The chapter describes learning procedures, focusing on well-known complex acquisition procedures along with a discussion of how they may further our understanding of anxiety disorders. It discusses fear conditioning data in humans, although animal data is discussed where such data are lacking. The chapter also touches upon context conditioning and chronic anxious apprehension, inhibition studies, and stimulus competition procedures. Complex acquisition procedures are therefore a useful tool to investigate individual differences in fear behavior.},

The first is Albert Ellis's rational-emotive behavior therapy (REBT), the second is the seminal work by Aaron T. Beck and colleagues and finally, by basic cognitive psychology investigating information processing in healthy controls. Based on these three lines of theory and research, a number of disorder-specific cognitive theories have been developed. Examples include cognitive models of panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). This chapter discusses a number of key concepts that are of relevance for cognitive theories across different anxiety disorders. Two illustrative examples for disorder-specific cognitive models are presented. The chapter concludes with a discussion of current controversies and future directions.},

Though groups with heightened anxiety vulnerability often exhibit, on average, elevated attention to threat, the evidence suggests that individuals are unlikely to each display a stable, invariant attentional bias to threat. Moreover, although existing assessment approaches can differentiate between groups, they do not exhibit the internal consistency or test-retest reliability necessary to classify individuals in terms of their characteristic pattern of attentional responding to threat.

	abstract = {Background
Cognitive bias modification (CBM) is a novel, but controversial intervention with considerable divergence amongst conclusions in individual studies and reviews. This systematic review synthesizes meta-analyses of CBM to determine whether CBM is effective, and what parameters most reliably evoke the process of CBM.
Methods
A systematic literature search resulted in twelve meta-analyses in total, from which the published effect sizes were extracted.
Results
Attention bias modification (ABM) shifted targeted biases in adults (ES = 0.24–1.16), was effective as a buffer to stressor vulnerability (ES = 0.33–0.77) and in symptom control (ES = 0.16–0.41). Cognitive bias modification for interpretation (CBM-I) modified targeted biases (ES = 0.52–0.81) but did not reliably reduce stressor vulnerability (ES = 0.01–0.24, p {\textgreater} .05). CBM consistently reduced anxiety symptoms, but effects on depressive symptomatology were less compelling. The long-term efficacy of CBM was only supported in addiction studies.
Limitations
The review included a single CBM-I only meta-analysis, and two meta-analyses with pooled reporting on ABM and CBM-I outcomes.
Conclusions
Overall, this synthesis shows CBM is effective in the short-term for anxiety in adults, and highlights some conditions under which CBM is most efficacious. Rather than debating the efficacy of CBM, future research should focus on developing procedures that more reliably induce bias modification and determining the most efficacious clinical applications.},

One important unresolved question is whether disorder-congruent threats capture attention to a greater extent than do more general or disorder-incongruent threat stimuli. Evidence for attention bias specificity in anxiety would implicate involvement of previous learning and memory processes in threat-related attention bias, whereas lack of content specificity would point to perturbations in more generic attention processes. Enhanced clarity of mechanism could have clinical implications for the stimuli types used in Attention Bias Modification Treatments (ABMT). Content specificity of threat-related attention bias in anxiety and potential moderators of this effect were investigated. A systematic search identified 37 samples from 29 articles (N=866). Relevant data were extracted based on specific coding rules, and Cohen's d effect size was used to estimate bias specificity effects. The results indicate greater attention bias toward disorder-congruent relative to disorder-incongruent threat stimuli (d=0.28, p{\textless}0.0001). This effect was not moderated by age, type of anxiety disorder, visual attention tasks, or type of disorder-incongruent stimuli. No evidence of publication bias was observed.

In contrast to this adaptive behavior, anxious, fearful, and phobic individuals show exaggerated attention biases to threat. In addition, they overestimate the likelihood of encountering their feared stimulus and the severity of the consequences; both are examples of expectancy biases. The co-occurrence of attention and expectancy biases in fear and anxiety raises the question about causal influences. Herein, we summarize findings related to expectancy biases in fear and anxiety, and their association with attention biases. We suggest that evidence calls for more comprehensive research strategies in the investigation of mutual influences between expectancy and attention biases, as well as their combined effects on fear and anxiety. Moreover, both types of bias need to be related to other types of distorted information processing commonly observed in fear and anxiety (e.g., memory and interpretation biases).

The between-groups differences showed that the anxious group recalled more threatening stimuli than the control group (d = 0.321). When we compared the group differences (anxious vs. control participants) in the within-groups effect (threatening vs. neutral stimuli), a moderate effect size emerged (dbw = 0.714).

	abstract = {Unrealistic, negative expectations are a core feature of psychopathology and may contribute to the development and chronicity of mental disorders. Although the exact content and characteristics of expectancy bias varies across disorders, a striking feature that all expectancy biases share is their apparent insensitivity to corrective information. This robustness of negative expectancy biases may help explain why mental disorders often run a chronic course. Yet, it also raises the critical question of why these biased expectations are so resistant to refutation. Understanding what factors contribute to the robustness of expectancy biases is not only important in its own right but also critical for improving currently available treatment procedures. In this chapter, we first describe and illustrate common methods and measures that are used to investigate negative expectancy biases. Next, the chapter focuses on the features of negative expectancy biases and on how negative expectancies may emerge. Subsequently, we address in more depth why once established negative expectancy biases are so resistant to change and how neural processes may be involved in this apparent insensitivity to disconfirming information. The chapter concludes with discussing some leads for future research about the mechanisms involved in the persistence of negative expectancy biases and about procedures that may help adjusting invalidating negative expectancy biases in people with mental disorders.},

	abstract = {In normal settings, our brain is able to update its stored representations in content, strength, and/or expectations by the memory reconsolidation process. Thus, a reactivated memory enters in a transient labile state (destabilization) followed by a re-stabilization phase in order to persist (memory reconsolidation). Cognitive neuroscience and its insight into psychiatric problems attributed a close relationship between memory (formation, maintenance, and utilization) and several mental disorders. In this framework, the reconsolidation process could be not only the mechanism for maintenance of some psychopathologies, but also open a novel therapeutic window. Here we aim to integrate recent experimental and theoretical research on memory reconsolidation and anxiety disorders maintenance. We propose a bayesian-like model about anxiety disorders persistence and postulate a new theoretical framework for how anxiety disorders are maintained through impaired memory updating due to a dysfunctional prediction error minimization strategy and anticipatory responses to threat.},

Participants then engaged in a behavioral avoidance task (BAT) that required them to approach and open a black box containing a spider that was placed 13 feet away. No significant differences between high and low spider fearful participants were found for expectancies for the spider picture—fear expression pairings. However, the high spider fear participants reported significantly higher expectancies than low spider fear participants for the spider picture—disgust expression pairings. Conversely, the low spider fear group reported significantly higher expectancies than the high spider fear participants for the spider picture—neutral expression pairings. Furthermore, higher expectancies for the disgust expression to be paired with spider pictures were significantly associated with avoidance on the BAT. These findings provide additional support for the role of disgust in spider phobia.},

	abstract = {In this meta-analytic and narrative review, we examine several overarching issues related to the study of coping, emotion regulation, and internalizing and externalizing symptoms of psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, including the conceptualization and measurement of these constructs. We report a quantitative meta-analysis of 212 studies (N = 80,850 participants) that measured the associations between coping and emotion regulation with symptoms of internalizing and externalizing psychopathology. Within the meta-analysis we address the association of broad domains of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., total coping, emotion regulation), intermediate factors of coping and emotion regulation (e.g., primary control coping, secondary control coping), and specific coping and emotion regulation strategies (e.g., emotional expression, cognitive reappraisal) with internalizing and externalizing symptoms. For cross-sectional studies, which made up the majority of studies included, we examine 3 potential moderators: age, measure quality, and single versus multiple informants. Finally, we separately consider findings from longitudinal studies as these provide stronger tests of the effects. After accounting for publication bias, findings indicate that the broad domain of emotion regulation and adaptive coping and the factors of primary control coping and secondary control coping are related to lower levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Further, the domain of maladaptive coping, the factor of disengagement coping, and the strategies of emotional suppression, avoidance, and denial are related to higher levels of symptoms of psychopathology. Finally, we offer a critique of the current state of the field and outline an agenda for future research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {A valuable experimental model for the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders is that they originate from a learned association between an intrinsically non-aversive event (Conditioned Stimulus, CS) and an anticipated disaster (Unconditioned Stimulus, UCS). Most anxiety disorders, however, do not evolve from a traumatic experience. Insights from neuroscience show that memory can be modified post-learning, which may elucidate how pathological fear can develop after relatively mild aversive events. Worrying - a process frequently observed in anxiety disorders - is a potential candidate to strengthen the formation of fear memory after learning. Here we tested in a discriminative fear conditioning procedure whether worry strengthens associative fear memory. Participants were randomly assigned to either a Worry (n = 23) or Control condition (n = 25). After fear acquisition, the participants in the Worry condition processed six worrisome questions regarding the personal aversive consequences of an electric stimulus (UCS), whereas the Control condition received difficult but neutral questions. Subsequently, extinction, reinstatement and re-extinction of fear were tested. Conditioned responding was measured by fear-potentiated startle (FPS), skin conductance (SCR) and UCS expectancy ratings. Our main results demonstrate that worrying resulted in increased fear responses (FPS) to both the feared stimulus (CS+) and the originally safe stimulus (CS−), whereas FPS remained unchanged in the Control condition. In addition, worrying impaired both extinction and re-extinction learning of UCS expectancy. The implication of our findings is that they show how worry may contribute to the development of anxiety disorders by affecting associative fear learning.},

	abstract = {Neuroimaging and neurophysiological studies have shown that nociceptive stimuli elicit responses in an extensive cortical network including somatosensory, insular and cingulate areas, as well as frontal and parietal areas. This network, often referred to as the “pain matrix”, is viewed as representing the activity by which the intensity and unpleasantness of the percept elicited by a nociceptive stimulus are represented. However, recent experiments have reported (i) that pain intensity can be dissociated from the magnitude of responses in the “pain matrix”, (ii) that the responses in the “pain matrix” are strongly influenced by the context within which the nociceptive stimuli appear, and (iii) that non-nociceptive stimuli can elicit cortical responses with a spatial configuration similar to that of the “pain matrix”. For these reasons, we propose an alternative view of the functional significance of this cortical network, in which it reflects a system involved in detecting, orienting attention towards, and reacting to the occurrence of salient sensory events. This cortical network might represent a basic mechanism through which significant events for the body's integrity are detected, regardless of the sensory channel through which these events are conveyed. This function would involve the construction of a multimodal cortical representation of the body and nearby space. Under the assumption that this network acts as a defensive system signaling potentially damaging threats for the body, emphasis is no longer on the quality of the sensation elicited by noxious stimuli but on the action prompted by the occurrence of potential threats.},

	abstract = {This functional magnetic resonance imaging study analysed the behavioural and neural responses during expectation-mediated placebo analgesia in a rectal pain model in healthy subjects. In N=36 healthy subjects, the blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) response during cued anticipation and painful rectal stimulation was measured. Using a within-subject design, placebo analgesia was induced by changing expectations regarding the probability of receiving an analgesic drug to 0\%, 50\%, and 100\%. Placebo responders were identified by median split based on pain reduction (0\% to 100\% conditions), and changes in neural activation correlating with pain reduction in the 0\% and 100\% conditions were assessed in a regions-of-interest analysis. Expectation of pain relief resulted in overall reductions in pain and urge to defecate, and this response was significantly more pronounced in responders. Within responders, pain reduction correlated with reduced activation of dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices, somatosensory cortex, and thalamus during cued anticipation (paired t tests on the contrast 0\%{\textgreater}100\%); during painful stimulation, pain reduction correlated with reduced activation of the thalamus. Compared with nonresponders, responders demonstrated greater placebo-induced decreases in activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during anticipation and in somatosensory cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus during pain. In conclusion, the expectation of pain relief can substantially change perceived painfulness of visceral stimuli, which is associated with activity changes in the thalamus, prefrontal, and somatosensory cortices. Placebo analgesia constitutes a paradigm to elucidate psychological components of the pain response relevant to the pathophysiology and treatment of chronic abdominal pain.},

We employed a paradigm in which two different visual cues signalled the upcoming picture presentation of either a spider or an innocuous animal (congruent condition). Unknown to the participants, the visual cue was incorrectly followed by a picture from the opposite category on two additional trials (incongruent condition). Cardiac and skin conductance responses were recorded from young adults with (n=15) or without (n=14) spider phobia during both the expectation and exposure of these pictures in the congruent and incongruent conditions. In the congruent condition, the autonomic responses during expectation matched the responses during exposure. In particular, non-phobic controls showed an orienting response (bradycardia and moderate skin conductance increase) to both picture categories, while spider phobics showed an orienting response to the innocuous animals and a defence response (tachycardia and marked skin conductance increase) to spiders. In the incongruent condition, the autonomic responses during exposure were driven by the affective content of the pictures, and their amplitude was greater than in the congruent condition, likely due to the signal–stimulus discrepancy. In particular, the response to the innocuous picture of phobic participants expecting a spider did not shift in the direction of the defence response. Thus, spider phobics did not show priming of the defensive system but maintained discrimination between phobic and innocuous stimuli. Finally, the greatly amplified response to the incorrectly signalled spider in phobics suggests a discrepancy–phobia interaction.},

Recent evidence suggests that alcohol produces selective SRD during uncertain but not certain threat. We systematically varied shock probability in a novel task assessing alcohol SRD during low probable/uncertain threat, while holding temporal precision of threat constant. Intoxicated (0.08\% target blood alcohol concentration) and placebo participants completed a cued shock threat task in which probability of shock administration at the offset of brief visual cues varied parametrically. High probability (100\%) shock cues represented certain threat as used in earlier research, while lower probability (20\% and 60\%) shock cues provided novel uncertain threat conditions. Startle potentiation during cues and inter-trial intervals (ITIs) served as the measure of affective response. General linear model analysis indicated that alcohol SRD magnitude increased monotonically as threat uncertainty increased. Alcohol SRD was significantly greater during 20\% and 60\% shock threat relative to 100\% shock threat. Alcohol also significantly reduced startle potentiation during distal threat in shock-free ITIs. Alcohol SRD magnitude during distal/uncertain threat was meaningfully moderated by individual differences in negative affectivity and weekly alcohol consumption. This work advances understanding of which properties of uncertainty are relevant to anxiety and anxiolytic effects of alcohol.},

Another consistent finding was that many parents reported that their children had great difficulty expressing their worries verbally and most showed their anxiety through changes in their behaviour.

QoL for autistic adults was lower than for the general population for each WHOQoL domain. Younger participants reported higher QoL than older participants in psychological and environment domains. Males reported higher physical QoL than females, and females reported higher social QoL than males. Significant positive predictors of QoL were: being employed (physical QoL), receiving support (social and environment QoL), and being in a relationship (social QoL).

While there has been increased research describing the typical and autism-specific anxiety symptomatology and assessing the effectiveness of potential interventions, there has been less research exploring the impact that elevated anxiety may have on an individual and their quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to explore the impact of anxiety on the QoL in children on the autism spectrum. Children and young adolescents on the spectrum were invited to participate in a self-report study measuring anxiety and health-related QoL (HRQoL). The sample consisted of 71 children, aged 6–13. Children who scored above the cut off for elevated anxiety on the autism-specific measure of anxiety (ASC-ASD) had poorer total HRQoL and poorer scores on the social, emotional, physical, and school functioning QoL domains. Regression analyses indicate that children's self-reported ratings of difficulties with uncertainty on the ASC-ASD predicted all domains of HRQoL, with higher levels of difficulty with uncertainty predicting poorer HRQoL. Elevated levels of anxious arousal were also predictive of poorer physical functioning. This study highlights the importance of exploring the impact of anxiety on individuals on the spectrum and suggests that using carefully planned interventions to reduce difficulties with uncertainty may be a potential way to work toward improving the QoL of children on the spectrum.

	abstract = {Background
A high proportion of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) also meet criteria for anxiety disorders. Few studies have explored the experience and impact of anxiety in autistic adults using qualitative methods.
Methods
Seventeen semi-structured interviews with either autistic adults (n=10) or the supporters of adults with a diagnosis of ASD (n=7) were conducted. The data were analysed using thematic analysis.
Results
Three main themes were identified: ‘contributing and mitigating factors to anxiety’, ‘consequences of anxiety’, and ‘management of anxiety’.
Discussion
Findings highlighted the role that uncertainty plays in anxiety in autism, supporting existing theoretical accounts. Implications for clinical practice were discussed. These included ensuring that communication differences are minimised, and highlighting the importance of meaningfully including autistic people throughout the development and evaluation process of interventions for mental health.},

Most of the research has focused on school-age children, ages 6 to 18 years. Yet, recent studies suggest that anxiety can emerge in young children, under 6 years, with ASD. This scoping review synthesized the literature on anxiety in young children with ASD. Three domains of anxiety research were reviewed: (a) prevalence/severity, phenomenology, and course; (b) correlates; and (c) treatment. Four online databases were searched from the start of the database until March 2020. Keywords pertaining to anxiety, autism, and young children were entered. The search identified 44 articles for inclusion. These studies varied with respect to sample source, informants, and measures to assess anxiety. The overall prevalence of anxiety ranged from 1.6 to 62\%. Sixteen of 17 studies found that young children with ASD had higher levels of anxiety compared to various control groups. A variety of DSM anxiety symptoms and disorders were present in young children with the most common symptoms being specific, social, and generalized fears. Correlates of anxiety included sensory over-responsivity, sleep disturbance, aggression/defiance, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Three cognitive behavioral treatment studies for anxiety and one developmental intervention targeting ASD symptoms showed promise in reducing anxiety. Findings indicate an early emergence of anxiety in some children with ASD. Further research on the measurement, pathophysiology, and treatment of anxiety in early childhood is critical to improving outcomes in children with ASD. Lay summary This scoping review synthesizes the literature on anxiety in young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Results indicate that children with ASD have higher levels of anxiety than children without ASD. Potential factors that could be contributing to anxiety include sensory, sleep, and behavioral problems. Preliminary studies show that anxiety can improve with cognitive behavioral treatment. These findings suggest that research on anxiety in young children with ASD should be prioritized to improve mental health outcomes.},

This study surveyed autistic adults on their special interest topics, intensity, and motivation. It also assessed the relationship between special interests and a range of quality of life measures including subjective wellbeing and domain specific life satisfaction. About two thirds of the sample reported having a special interest, with relatively more males reporting a special interest than females. Special interest topics included computers, autism, music, nature and gardening. Most autistic adults engaged in more than one special interest, highlighting that these interests may not be as narrow as previously described. There were no differences in subjective wellbeing between autistic adults with and without special interests. However, for autistic adults who did have special interests, motivation for engaging in special interests was associated with increased subjective wellbeing. This indicates that motivation may play an important role in our understanding of special interests in autism. Special interests had a positive impact on autistic adults and were associated with higher subjective wellbeing and satisfaction across specific life domains including social contact and leisure. However, a very high intensity of engagement with special interests was negatively related to wellbeing.

The purpose of this paper is to examine sex differences in parent-reported quantity, content and functional impairment of children’s interests. Design/methodology/approach Parent responses to the Interests Scale were analyzed using descriptive statistics and ANOVAs to determine diagnostic (ASD vs typical development (TD)) and sex differences between four groups of children ages six to ten years: ASD males, ASD females, TD males and TD females. Findings Groups were comparable on the quantity of interests reported on the Interests Scale. Children with ASD demonstrated significantly more nonsocial interests and had greater functional impairment associated with their interests than TD children. A significant diagnosis×sex effect was found for the number of interests in folk psychology. Descriptively, males with ASD were more likely to have a primary interest in the traditionally male category of physics than females with ASD whose primary interest mainly fell into the categories of TV or the more traditionally female category of psychology. Originality/value These findings strengthen the results of Turner-Brown et al. (2011) by replicating their findings that children with ASD have more nonsocial interests and greater functional impairments related to their interests compared to TD children in a sample that is balanced on biological sex. However, there are distinctions between males and females with ASD in their primary interests that have implications for diagnostic assessment.},

	abstract = {Background
Restricted and Repetitive Behaviours (RRB) are a core characteristic of autism, though little is known about autistic people’s lived experience of these phenomena. Research has defined RRB in terms of: 1) a distinction between higher-order and lower-order RRB; as well as 2) a perceived lack of function and 3) a perceived lack of voluntary control.
Method
Twelve autistic adults without intellectual disability were interviewed to elucidate an understanding of these three issues from their lived experience.
Results
Thematic analysis identified four key themes regarding RRB: Self-regulation; positive impacts; negative impacts and suppression. The distinction between higher-order and lower-order RRB was not reflected in the adults’ lived experience. In addition to having both positive and negative impacts, the expression of RRB for some behaviours in certain contexts was largely, though not wholly, under voluntary control. Perceived negative evaluations from others can result in strategies to minimise the expression of RRB to observers, although suppressing RRB can be stressful with a cost to the individual.
Conclusions
These findings provide insight into the important functions of RRB and both its positive and negative impacts. It indicates that future research should look to help maximise the positive impacts and minimize the negative, and consider the impact suppression of RRB has on mental health and functioning.},

The premise is that individuals who are prone to anxiety show an altered interoceptive prediction signal, i.e., manifest augmented detection of the difference between the observed and expected body state. As a consequence, the increased prediction signal of a prospective aversive body state triggers an increase in anxious affect, worrisome thoughts and other avoidance behaviors. The anterior insula is proposed to play a key role in this process. Further testing of this model—which should include investigation of genetic and environmental influences—may lead to the development of novel treatments that attenuate this altered interoceptive prediction signal in patients with anxiety disorders.},

Few studies have explored this hypothesis prospectively. This study had two goals: (1) examine whether sensory over-responsivity is predictive of the development of anxiety in a large prospective sample of children, and (2) identify whether anxiety mediates the relationship between sensory over-responsivity and behavioral challenges. Children’s sensory and anxiety symptoms were assessed in a community sample of 917 at 2–5 and again in 191 of these children at 6 years old. Parents also reported on a number of additional behavioral challenges previously found to be associated with both sensory over-responsivity and anxiety separately: irritability, food selectivity, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal problems. Forty three percent of preschool children with sensory over-responsivity also had a concurrent impairing anxiety disorder. Preschool sensory over-responsivity symptoms significantly and positively predicted anxiety symptoms at age six. This relationship was both specific and unidirectional. Finally, school-age anxiety symptoms mediated the relationship between preschool sensory over-responsivity symptoms and both irritability and sleep problems at school-age. These results suggest sensory over-responsivity is a risk factor for anxiety disorders.

This study assessed the impact of sensory hypersensitivity on the clinical symptoms of specific phobia, separation anxiety, social anxiety and I/S for autistic and typically developing (TD) children. Parents of 79 children completed questionnaires on their child’s difficulties related to sensory processing, I/S, and anxiety. Results demonstrated that sensory hypersensitivity mediated 67\% of the relationship between symptoms of specific phobia and I/S and 57\% of the relationship between separation anxiety and I/S. No relationship was observed between sensory hypersensitivity and social anxiety. These mediation effects of sensory hypersensitivity were found only in autistic children, not in TD children.},

Among the 11 studies about sensory processing that were selected, 7 investigated the association with adaptive behaviours and 5 with attention. Atypical sensory processing was reported in 82\% to 97\% of the participants with ASD, depending on the study. This review found a significant impact of sensory abnormalities on adaptive behaviour.

	abstract = {Background: Unusual responses to sensory stimuli are seen in many children with autism. Their presence was highlighted both in early accounts of autism and in more recent first-person descriptions. There is a widespread belief that sensory symptoms characterize autism and differentiate it from other disorders. This paper examines the empirical evidence for this assumption. Method: All controlled experimental laboratory investigations published since 1960 were identified through systematic searches using Medline/PubMed and PsycInfo search engines. A total of 48 empirical papers and 27 theoretical or conceptual papers were reviewed. Results: Sensory symptoms are more frequent and prominent in children with autism than in typically developing children, but there is not good evidence that these symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Certain groups, including children with fragile X syndrome and those who are deaf-blind, appear to demonstrate higher rates of sensory symptoms than children with autism. In reviewing the evidence relevant to two theories of sensory dysfunction in autism, over- and under-arousal theory, we find that there is very little support for hyper-arousal and failure of habituation in autism. There is more evidence that children with autism, as a group, are hypo-responsive to sensory stimuli, but there are also multiple failures to replicate findings and studies that demonstrate lack of group differences. Conclusions: The use of different methods, the study of different sensory modalities, and the changing scientific standards across decades complicate interpretation of this body of work. We close with suggestions for future research in this area.},

	abstract = {Several models of anxiety in autistic adults have focused on the role of intolerance of uncertainty which has biological and evolutionary bases, as a cognitive explanation for the high prevalence of anxiety in autism. This framework suggests that all people are born with a healthy level of intolerance of uncertainty, and as we develop, this intolerance is lessened as we learn when situations are safe and begin to understand and manage the uncertainty. This process of learning about managing uncertainty does not happen in the same way in those who are high in autistic traits, which could be the reason for the high levels of anxiety symptoms commonly seen in this population. We examined archival data of 199 non-autistic and 55 autistic adults from prior studies in which we collected self-report measures of autistic traits, intolerance of uncertainty, sensory processing, and anxiety. We conducted two path analyses to examine the role of intolerance of uncertainty in anxiety in autistic adults. The first model tested the idea that intolerance of uncertainty, an evolutionary phenomenon common for all people, could explain some of the cognitive aspects of anxiety in autism. The second model suggests that primary neurodevelopmental differences associated with autistic traits underlie the sensory sensitivity and sensory seeking behaviors, which in turn increase intolerance of uncertainty and subsequent anxiety. We found that the “neurodevelopmental” model had better model fit than the “evolutionary stress” model, suggesting that the neurodevelopmental impact of higher levels of autistic traits could moderate a non-autistic trajectory of learning to manage uncertainty as children develop and understand that uncertainty is common and acceptable.},

Autistic individuals with alexithymia could therefore represent a specific subgroup of autism who may benefit from tailored interventions. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to explore the nature and prevalence of alexithymia in autism using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS).Methods:Online scientific databases were searched systematically for studies on ASD popu lations using the TAS. Meta-analyses were performed to evaluate differences in scores between the ASD and neurotypical groups, and to determine the prevalence of alexithymia in these populations.Results:15 articles comparing autistic and neurotypical (NT) groups were identified. Autistic people scored significantly higher on all scores compared to the NT group. There was also a higher prevalence of alexithymia in the ASD group (49.93\% compared to 4.89\%), with a significantly increased risk of alexithymia in autistic participants.Conclusions:This review highlights that alexithymia is common, rather than universal, in ASD, supporting a growing body of evidence that co-occurring autism and alexithymia represents a specific subgroup in the ASD population that may have specific clinical needs. More research is needed to understand the nature and implications of co-occurring ASD and alexithymia.},

Many autistic individuals experience significant social-communication difficulties and elevated anxiety/depression and alexithymia. Nevertheless, the role of alexithymia in explaining individual variability in the quality/severity of social-communication difficulties and/or anxiety and depression symptoms in autism remains poorly understood.MethodsIn total, 337 adolescents and adults (autism N = 179) were assessed for alexithymia on the Toronto Alexithymia Scale and for social-communication difficulties, anxiety and depression symptoms. A total of 135 individuals (autism N = 76) were followed up 12–24 months later. We used regression models to establish cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between alexithymia, social-communication difficulties, anxiety and depression symptoms.ResultsAutistic individuals reported significantly higher alexithymia than comparison individuals (p {\textless} 0.001, r effect size = 0.48), with 47.3\% of autistic females and 21.0\% of autistic males meeting cut-off for clinically relevant alexithymia (score ⩾61). Difficulties in describing feelings were particularly associated with current self-reported social-communication difficulties [p {\textless} 0.001, β = 0.57, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.44–0.67] and predicted later social-communication difficulties (p = 0.02, β = 0.43, 95\% CI 0.07–0.82).

	abstract = {Alexithymia is a sub-clinical construct, traditionally characterized by difficulties identifying and describing one's own emotions. Despite the clear need for interoception (interpreting physical signals from the body) when identifying one's own emotions, little research has focused on the selectivity of this impairment. While it was originally assumed that the interoceptive deficit in alexithymia is specific to emotion, recent evidence suggests that alexithymia may also be associated with difficulties perceiving some non-affective interoceptive signals, such as one's heart rate. It is therefore possible that the impairment experienced by those with alexithymia is common to all aspects of interoception, such as interpreting signals of hunger, arousal, proprioception, tiredness and temperature. In order to determine whether alexithymia is associated with selectively impaired affective interoception, or general interoceptive impairment, we investigated the association between alexithymia and self-reported non-affective interoceptive ability, and the extent to which individuals perceive similarity between affective and non-affective states (both measured using questionnaires developed for the purpose of the current study), in both typical individuals (n = 105 (89 female), mean age = 27.5 years) and individuals reporting a diagnosis of a psychiatric condition (n = 103 (83 female), mean age = 31.3 years). Findings indicated that alexithymia was associated with poor non-affective interoception and increased perceived similarity between affective and non-affective states, in both the typical and clinical populations. We therefore suggest that rather than being specifically associated with affective impairment, alexithymia is better characterized by a general failure of interoception.},

However, research indicates that alexithymia – characterized by difficulties in recognizing emotions from internal bodily sensations – is also linked to atypical interoception. Elevated rates of alexithymia in the autistic population have been shown to underpin several socio-emotional impairments thought to be symptomatic of ASD, raising the possibility that interoceptive difficulties in ASD are also due to co-occurring alexithymia. Following this line of inquiry, the present study examined the relative impact of alexithymia and autism on interoceptive accuracy (IA). Across two experiments, it was found that alexithymia, not autism, was associated with atypical interoception.

	abstract = {Interoception, the perception of one’s internal state, is commonly quantified using the heartbeat counting task (HCT) – which is thought to be a measure of cardiac interoceptive sensitivity (accuracy). Interoceptive sensitivity has been associated with a number of clinical traits and aspects of higher order cognition, including emotion processing and decision-making. It has been proposed that alexithymia (difficulties identifying and describing one’s own emotions) is associated with impaired interoceptive sensitivity, but new research questions this association. Problematically, much evidence attesting to the absence of this association has been conducted using the HCT, a measure affected by various physiological and psychological factors. Here, we present novel data (N = 287) examining the relationship between alexithymia and HCT performance, controlling for a number of potential confounds. Inclusion of these control measures reveals the predicted negative relationship between alexithymia and HCT performance. Results are discussed with regard to difficulties quantifying interoceptive sensitivity using the HCT.},

Alexithymia is defined by difficulties in identifying and describing one's emotions and externally oriented thinking.

It is largely assumed that alexithymia relates negatively both to subjective and objective interoception. However, evidence is scarce for the latter relation.

	abstract = {Background Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) commonly show sensory over-responsivity (SOR), an impairing condition related to over-reactive brain and behavioral responses to aversive stimuli. While individuals with ASD often show atypically high physiological arousal, it is unclear how this relates to sensory reactivity. We therefore investigated how physiological arousal relates to brain and behavioral indices of SOR, to inform understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying SOR and to determine whether physiological measures are associated with SOR-related brain responses. Methods Youth aged 8–18 (49 ASD; 30 age- and performance-IQ-matched typically developing (TD)) experienced mildly aversive tactile and auditory stimuli first during functional magnetic resonance imaging (N = 41 ASD, 26 TD) and then during skin conductance (SCR) (N = 48 ASD, 28 TD) and heart rate (HR) measurements (N = 48 ASD, 30 TD). Parents reported on their children’s SOR severity. Results Autism Spectrum Disorder youth overall displayed greater SCR to aversive sensory stimulation than TD youth and greater baseline HR. Within ASD, higher SOR was associated with higher mean HR across all stimuli after controlling for baseline HR. Furthermore, the ASD group overall, and the ASD-high-SOR group in particular, showed reduced HR deceleration/greater acceleration to sensory stimulation compared to the TD group. Both SCR and HR were associated with brain responses to sensory stimulation in regions previously associated with SOR and sensory regulation. Conclusions Autism Spectrum Disorder youth displayed heightened physiological arousal to mildly aversive sensory stimulation, with HR responses in particular showing associations with brain and behavioral measures of SOR. These results have implications for using psychophysiological measures to assess SOR, particularly in individuals with ASD who cannot undergo MRI.},

	abstract = {Background: Autistic adults have an elevated risk of many health problems compared with the general population, making health care access extra critical. Unfortunately, autistic people often find health care settings quite aversive, and many medical providers report feeling unsure about how to interact with autistic patients. We aimed at characterizing specific challenges regarding sensory experiences and communicative barriers in health care settings.

Methods: We recruited adults to complete an anonymous online questionnaire on the topic of improving health care experiences for everyone. The questions covered demographics, sensory experiences in medical settings, and communication with health care providers. We quantified the associations between autism diagnosis and experiences of sensory discomfort and communication barriers in health care settings. We also did a qualitative analysis of text responses to questions on how to improve sensory environments and communication with providers.

Results: Swedish adults (62 autistic and 36 nonautistic) participated in the study. The cohort was well educated, and autistic participants received their autism diagnosis late in life (median age 36 years, range 13–57). Compared with nonautistic participants, autistic participants reported greater discomfort with background sound levels in health care settings and felt more misunderstood by health care providers. Thematic analyses showed that auditory stimuli and proximity to other people were particularly bothersome for autistic participants, causing stress or avoidance and affecting the ability to interact with providers. Providers contributed to communication barriers by failing to recognize the need for individualized information, especially when respondents' difficulties were not visible or taken seriously. Participants requested greater clarity and supplementary written information. Providers also misunderstood autistic adults' body language or eye contact patterns, as they interpreted their clients through the lens of neurotypical expectations.

Conclusions: Our results extend previous research by emphasizing sensory aspects of health care settings and suggesting specific and reasonable adaptations. The results also highlight how the provider's implicit expectations of nonverbal communication caused misinterpretations of autistic people who were socially skilled but did not use typical body language. Based on the data, we suggest specific adaptations, many of which may also benefit nonautistic people.},

Jahrhunderts in einem engen Zusammenhang zwischen dem Verein für Sozialpolitik, der daraus mit Max Weber hervorgegangenen Deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie und den Medizinern Virchow, Salomon Neumann und ihren Nachfolgern ausdrückt. Das Dritte Reich machte dem ein Ende, einerseits durch die Vertreibung und Ermordung von Fachvertretern, andererseits durch eine langanhaltende Kompromittierung durch diejenigen Fachvertreter, die sich auf eine Verbindung von medizin- und gesundheitssoziologischen Ansätzen mit dem Rassismus einließen. Eine ähnlich frühe, aber nicht unterbrochene Kooperation lässt sich für Großbritannien, die skandinavischen Länder und Frankreich zeigen. Heute berufen sich führende Epidemiologen wie Marmot (vgl. Marmot 1998) auf den Soziologen Emile Durkheim als einen wichtigen Begründer der analytischen Epidemiologie, weil er die seit Jahrhunderten immer wieder entdeckten Korrelationen zwischen Erkrankungen und beruflichen Lebensbedingungen um das Argument erweiterte, Soziales könne nur durch Soziales erklärt werden (Durkheim 1897).},

As an integrative theoretical analysis, this volume pulls together two decades of research and thought on issues in behavioral medicine, emotion, stress management, treatment, and life span development. A selective review of the most pertinent literature is included in each chapter. The total reference listing for the book extends to 60 pages. This work is necessarily multidisciplinary, reflecting the many dimensions of stress-related problems and their situation within a complex social context. While the emphasis is on psychological aspects of stress, the book is oriented towards professionals in various disciplines, as well as advanced students and educated laypersons.

	abstract = {Introduction: Burnout, inertia, meltdown, and shutdown (BIMS) have been identified as important parts of some autistic people’s lives. This study builds on our previous work that offered early academic descriptions of these phenomena, based on the perspectives of autistic adults.Objectives: This study aimed to explore the unique knowledge and insights of eight autistic children and youth to extend and refine our earlier description of burnout, inertia, and meltdown, with additional exploration of shutdown. We also aimed to explore how these youth cope with these phenomena and what others around them do that make things better or worse, with a hope to glean knowledge to design better supports.Methods: One-to-one interviews were conducted with eight children and youth, who shared their experience with BIMS. To match individual communication strengths of children and youth, we took a flexible approach to interviews, allowing for augmentative communication systems and use of visual images to support verbal interviews, as needed. We conducted a reflexive, inductive thematic analysis, using an iterative process of coding, collating, reviewing, and mapping themes.Findings: Our analysis has identified that these youth describe BIMS as a multi-faceted experience involving emotional, cognitive and physical components. Moreover, these multifaceted experiences are often misunderstood by neurotypical adults, which contributes to inadequate support in managing BIMS. Of the four experiences, these youth identified meltdowns as most common.Conclusion: By gaining first-hand perspectives, we have identified novel insights into BIMS and developed a more holistic understanding of these phenomena. These youths’ descriptions of supportive strategies for BIMS stress the importance of compassion and collaboration from trusted adults. This new knowledge will provide a foundation for how to better support autistic children and youth. Further research is required to develop an understanding of BIMS, especially with respect to how it is experienced by children and youth. Future research should leverage the insights and experiential knowledge of autistic children and youth to co-design support tool(s) for BIMS.},

	title = {A motivational control theory of cognitive fatigue},
	isbn = {978-1-4338-0839-5},
	abstract = {This chapter argues that fatigue is a problem of the management of control rather than of energy. Thorndike (1900) interpreted fatigue as a problem of doing the right thing, rather than of doing too much. Bartley and Chute (1947) considered fatigue a result of conflict between competing behavioral tendencies—between doing and not doing, between doing one thing and doing another. The idea that the resolution of conflict is an effective basis for the control of action is a familiar one (Berlyne, 1960; Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, \& Cohen, 2001; Norman \& Shallice, 1986), with cognitive control acting to maintain selected tasks and prevent disruption by competing activities. Fatigue is interpreted here as an adaptive state, serving to maintain effective overall (system-wide) management of goals. In this conceptualization, the subjective experience of fatigue arises through conflict between current and competing goals, or action tendencies. In effect, it is assumed to have a signal value for motivational control, providing a mechanism for resolving conflicts between current goals and other desired courses of action. This approach is developed in the rest of the chapter by considering the boundary conditions for the experience and impact of fatigue, especially in relation to work. The focus is necessarily broader than fatigue itself, as fatigue is considered to be one aspect of the general control system that manages goal activity in the service of motivational requirements. A fundamental assumption of traditional theory is that fatigue is caused by work, but the nature of the work may be important: Does it matter how much effort is applied by the performer or how much control he or she has over what is done? A second assumption is that fatigue causes decrements in the performance of tasks (as a result of prolonged work without rest), but this is not always found to be the case. Researchers consider the nature of performance decrement, and the reasons why task goals may fail, both with the need to maintain them over time and, in the broader context, under the impact of stress and high workload. This leads to considering the general model of motivational control in task performance, in which goal management is conceived of as an essentially compensatory process (Hockey, 1997, 2005). At least for highly motivated tasks, primary task goals appear to be stabilized by increased regulatory control, with associated costs. Over the final part of the chapter, the compensatory control model is adapted and extended to focus on the specific problem of cognitive fatigue and its implications for patterns of performance decrement. In this model, fatigue is interpreted as an adaptive state that signals a growing conflict in control activity between what is being done and what else might be done, between old goals and new goals, and between duties and desires.

	abstract = {Prolonged continuous performance of a cognitively demanding task induces cognitive fatigue and is associated with a time-related deterioration of objective performance, the degree of which is referred to cognitive fatigability. Although the neural underpinnings of cognitive fatigue are poorly understood, prior studies report changes in neural activity consistent with deterioration of task-related networks over time. While compensatory brain activity is reported to maintain motor task performance in the face of motor fatigue and cognitive performance in the face of other stressors (e.g., aging) and structural changes, there are no studies to date demonstrating compensatory activity for cognitive fatigue. High-density electroencephalography was recorded from human subjects during a 160 min continuous performance of a cognitive control task. While most time-varying neural activity showed a linear decline over time, we identified an evoked potential over the anterior frontal region which demonstrated an inverted U-shaped time-on-task profile. This evoked brain activity peaked between 60 and 100 min into the task and was positively associated with better behavioral performance only during this interval. Following the peak and during subsequent decline of this anterior frontal activity, the rate of performance decline also accelerated. These findings demonstrate that this anterior frontal brain activity, which is not part of the primary task-related activity at baseline, is recruited to compensate for fatigue-induced impairments in the primary task-related network, and that this compensation terminates as cognitive fatigue further progresses. These findings may be relevant to understanding individual differences in cognitive fatigability and developing interventions for clinical conditions afflicted by fatigue.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Fatigue refers to changes in objective performance and subjective effort induced by continuous task performance. We examined the neural underpinnings of cognitive fatigue in humans using a prolonged continuous performance task and high-density electroencephalography with the goal of determining whether compensatory processes exist to maintain performance in the face of fatigue. We identified brain activity demonstrating an inverted U-shaped time-on-task profile. This brain activity showed features consistent with a compensatory role including: peaking between 60 and 100 min into the task, a positive association with behavioral performance only during this interval, and accelerated performance decline following its peak. These findings may be relevant to understanding individual differences in cognitive fatigue and developing interventions for clinical conditions afflicted by fatigue.},

Target letters were presented at three different perceptual loads and with a peripheral distractor letter. Three target–distractor conditions were tested: congruent, incongruent, and neutral. Results showed that, overall, error rates and reaction times increased with ToT. The detrimental effect of fatigue on performance was most pronounced in the high perceptual load condition. Importantly, however, we also found that fatigue-related ignorance of distractors was compromised in the low perceptual load condition, but not in the medium or high perceptual load condition. This finding is in accordance with the perceptual load theory and refines the knowledge about the declining cognitive performance under fatigue.},

Some theorists (e.g. Humphreys \& Revelle, 1984; Sarason, 1988) argue that anxiety causes worry, and worry always impairs performance on tasks with high attentional or short-term memory demands. According to the processing efficiency theory, worry has two main effects: (1) a reduction in the storage and processing capacity of the working memory system available for a concurrent task; and (2) an increment in on-task effort and activities designed to improve performance. There is a crucial distinction within the theory between performance effectiveness (= quality of performance) and processing efficiency (= performance effectiveness divided by effort).

In addition to decreasing attentional control, anxiety increases attention to threat-related stimuli. Adverse effects of anxiety on processing efficiency depend on two central executive functions involving attentional control: inhibition and shifting. However, anxiety may not impair performance effectiveness (quality of performance) when it leads to the use of compensatory strategies (e.g., enhanced effort; increased use of processing resources).

New assessment tools are needed to enable identification and diagnosis. Here, we sought to identify factors associated with severity, develop an autistic burnout assessment and test the prepublication AASPIRE Autistic Burnout Measure tool. A co-produced survey of 141 autistic adults with experience of autistic burnout (98\% above cut-off for depression) was subjected to exploratory factor analysis and scale reduction to identify a grouping of Autistic Burnout Severity Items. Autistic Burnout Severity Items showed strong overall internal consistency and acceptable internal consistency across four factors. Masking and depression were associated with the Autistic Burnout Severity Items, once variation in alexithymia, interoception, repetitive behaviours, sensory sensitivities and autism severity had been adjusted for. There is some suggestion that the Autistic Burnout Measure may not be as robust as the Autistic Burnout Severity Items, particularly as it showed a significant relationship with depression but not masking. Our findings alongside recent literature highlight a core phenomenon, comprising exhaustion, withdrawal and cognitive overload, associated with stressors potentially unique to autistic people. Further disambiguation from autistic shutdown and other conditions is needed in work towards the measurement of autistic burnout.
Lay abstract
Autistic burnout has been talked about by autistic adults for some time on blogs and in social media. Now, research describes fatigue, exhaustion and other related symptoms experienced by autistic people. We need new ways to help identify autistic burnout. In this study, we tested a new questionnaire called the AASPIRE Autistic Burnout Measure, and we investigated things that are linked to worse autistic burnout. We also trialled a group of Autistic Burnout Severity Items that we made. Working with an autistic researcher, we made the Autistic Burnout Severity Items based on published definitions of autistic burnout. Autistic adults (n = 141) who had experienced autistic burnout completed an online survey. We found that autistic burnout was connected to masking and depression. The Autistic Burnout Measure tool was associated with depression but not with masking. It was not very accurate in telling apart participants who were currently experiencing burnout versus those who were reporting on their past experience. The Autistic Burnout Severity Items might have problems with subscales adding together to measure autistic burnout. More work is needed on how to measure autistic burnout. Our research and other recent studies show autistic people experience a combination of exhaustion, withdrawal and problems with their concentration and thinking. Burnout seems to be linked to the stress experienced by autistic people in their daily lives. We need more research to understand the difference between autistic burnout and other conditions and experiences. We need to develop assessment tools that can help identify this burnout.},

Findings to date suggest that factors associated with being autistic and the widespread lack of autism awareness and acceptance within society contribute to the onset and recurrence of autistic burnout. Based on autistic adults' descriptions of their lived experiences, a Conceptual Model of Autistic Burnout (CMAB) is proposed, which describes a series of hypothesized relationships between identified risk and protective factors that may contribute to, or buffer against, autistic burnout. The theoretical framework for the CMAB is based on the Social-Relational model of disability and neurodiversity paradigm, and the Job Demands-Resources model of burnout, and Conservation of Resources theory. The CMAB offers a holistic perspective for understanding individual, social, and environmental factors that can influence autistic burnout via various direct and indirect pathways.

The aim of the study is to identify the role of vital personal resources understood as selected health-promoting behaviours, such as (1) stress-coping strategies, (2) sleep hygiene, and (3) using annual vacation leave, in the process of the regeneration. In a cross-sectional survey, the following variables have been assessed: 1) work-related stress using the Psychosocial Risk Scale, 2) occupational burnout using the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), 3) chronic fatigue using the Polish adaptation of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), and selected health behaviours of academic teachers 4) stress-coping strategies with the help of the Polish version of Mini-COPE and 5) rest: the amount of sleep and vacation days devoted to rest using a short questionnaire designed by the authors. The sample (N = 340) was comprised of academic teachers employed at Polish higher education institutions who have experienced changes in the work environment in recent years. We conducted a multiple regression analysis to determine the relationships among stress, burnout, and chronic fatigue, looking at coping strategies and rest as a moderator. The results indicate that there is a strong relationship between stress resulting from an excessively demanding work environment on the one hand and occupational burnout and chronic fatigue on the other. At the same time, selected health behaviours of academic teachers only slightly moderate the analyzed relationship. Avoidance strategies strengthen the relationship between stress and its negative consequences, while rest and—to a limited extent—the amount of sleep only slightly contribute to weakening the analyzed relationship.},

	abstract = {Background: Compared with adults in the general population, autistic adults are more likely to experience poor mental health, which can contribute to increased suicidality. While the autistic community has long identified autistic burnout as a significant mental health risk, to date, only one study has been published. Early research has highlighted the harmful impact of autistic burnout among autistic adults and the urgent need to better understand this phenomenon.

Methods: To understand the lived experiences of autistic adults, we used data scraping to extract public posts about autistic burnout from 2 online platforms shared between 2005 and 2019, which yielded 1127 posts. Using reflexive thematic analysis and an inductive “bottom-up” approach, we sought to understand the etiology, symptoms, and impact of autistic burnout, as well as prevention and recovery strategies. Two autistic researchers with self-reported experience of autistic burnout reviewed the themes and provided insight and feedback.

Results: We identified eight primary themes and three subthemes across the data. (1) Systemic, pervasive lack of autism awareness. (1.1) Discrimination and stigma. (2) A chronic or recurrent condition. (3) Direct impact on health and well-being. (4) A life unlived. (5) A blessing in disguise? (6) Self-awareness and personal control influence risk. (6.1) “You need enough balloons to manage the weight of the rocks.” (7) Masking: Damned if you do, damned if you don't. (8) Ask the experts. (8.1) Stronger together. The overarching theme was that a pervasive lack of awareness and stigma about autism underlie autistic burnout.

Conclusions: We identified a set of distinct yet interrelated factors that characterize autistic burnout as a recurring condition that can, directly and indirectly, impact autistic people's functioning, mental health, quality of life, and well-being. The findings suggest that increased awareness and acceptance of autism could be key to burnout prevention and recovery.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that individual differences in interoception (the perception of the body’s internal state) can be divided into three distinct dimensions: interoceptive accuracy (performance on objective tests of interoceptive accuracy), interoceptive sensibility (self-reported beliefs concerning one’s own interoception) and interoceptive awareness (a metacognitive measure indexed by the correspondence between interoceptive accuracy and interoceptive sensibility). Research conducted under this model underscores the importance of interoceptive awareness for a variety of disorder-specific and transdiagnostic symptoms. However, the clinical importance of interoceptive awareness means that this aspect of interoception warrants further scrutiny, and such scrutiny suggests that revision of the three-dimensional model of interoception is necessary. In this theoretical paper, we outline such a revision, highlighting a need to distinguish not only how interoception is measured (objective measures vs. self-report), but also what is measured (accuracy vs. attention). The model refines how individual differences in interoception are categorised, with important consequences for the measurement of interoceptive awareness. Such a revision may help researchers to identify the strengths and weaknesses in interoception observed across clinical conditions, and to isolate clinically relevant individual differences.},

Metacognition operates over a range of cognitive domains, such as perception and memory, but the neurocognitive architecture supporting this ability remains controversial. Is metacognition enabled by a common, domain-general resource that is recruited to evaluate performance on a variety of tasks? Or is metacognition reliant on domain-specific modules? This article reviews recent literature on the domain-generality of human metacognition, drawing on evidence from individual differences and neuroimaging. A meta-analysis of behavioral studies found that perceptual metacognitive ability was correlated across different sensory modalities, but found no correlation between metacognition of perception and memory. However, evidence for domain-generality from behavioral data may suffer from a lack of power to identify correlations across model parameters indexing metacognitive efficiency. Neuroimaging data provide a complementary perspective on the domain-generality of metacognition, revealing co-existence of neural signatures that are common and distinct across tasks. We suggest that such an architecture may be appropriate for “tagging” generic feelings of confidence with domain-specific information, in turn forming the basis for priors about self-ability and modulation of higher-order behavioral control.},

	abstract = {Stress can affect cognition in many ways, with the outcome (i.e., facilitating or impairing) depending on a combination of factors related to both stress and the cognitive function under study. Among the factors identified as particularly relevant to define the cognitive effects of stress are the intensity or magnitude of stress, its origin (i.e., whether triggered by the task or externally), and its duration (i.e., whether acute or chronically delivered). At the cognitive end, the specific cognitive operation (e.g., implicit or explicit memory, long-term or working memory, goal-directed or habit learning) and information processing phases (e.g., learning, consolidation, and retrieval) are essential as well to define stress effects. The emerging view is that mild stress tends to facilitate cognitive function, particularly in implicit memory or simple declarative tasks or when the cognitive load is not excessive. Exposure to high or very high stress acutely (whether elicited by the cognitive task or experienced before being trained or tested in the task) or chronically impairs the formation of explicit memories and, more generally, of those that require complex, flexible reasoning (as typically observed for hippocampus- and prefrontal cortex-related functions) while improving performance of implicit memory and well-rehearsed tasks (as reported for amygdala-dependent conditioning tasks and for striatum-related processes). In addition to these general principles, there are important individual differences in the cognitive impact of stress, with gender and age being particularly influencing factors.

Here, we applied a dynamic Bayesian model to a large fMRI data set of the stop signal task to address this issue. By estimating the probability of the stop signal – p(Stop) – trial by trial, we showed that higher p(Stop) is associated with prolonged go trial reaction time (RT), indicating proactive control of motor response. In modeling fMRI signals at trial and target onsets, we distinguished activities of proactive control, prediction error, and RT slowing. We showed that the anterior pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) responds specifically to increased stop signal likelihood, and its activity is correlated with activations of the posterior pre-SMA and bilateral anterior insula during prolonged response times. This directional link is also supported by Granger causality analysis. Furthermore, proactive control, prediction error, and time-on-task are each mapped to distinct areas in the medial prefrontal cortex. Together, these findings dissect regional functions of the medial prefrontal cortex in cognitive control and provide system level evidence associating conflict anticipation with its motor consequence.},

Results showed a highly significant positive correlation between the number of ADHD traits and the frequency of reported sensory processing problems.

	abstract = {Objective
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently co-occur. Given the heterogeneity of both disorders, several more homogeneous ASD–ADHD comorbidity subgroups may exist. The current study examined whether such subgroups exist, and whether their overlap or distinctiveness in associated comorbid symptoms and cognitive profiles gives support for a gradient overarching disorder hypothesis or a separate disorders hypothesis.
Method
Latent class analysis was performed on Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and Conners' Parent Rating Scale (CPRS-R:L) data for 644 children and adolescents (5 through 17 years of age). Classes were compared for comorbid symptoms and cognitive profiles of motor speed and variability, executive functioning, attention, emotion recognition, and detail-focused processing style.
Results
Latent class analysis revealed five classes: two without behavioral problems, one with only ADHD behavior, and two with both clinical symptom levels of ASD and ADHD but with one domain more prominent than the other (ADHD[+ASD] and ASD[+ADHD]). In accordance with the gradient overarching disorder hypothesis were the presence of an ADHD class without ASD symptoms and the absence of an ASD class without ADHD symptoms, as well as cognitive functioning of the simple ADHD class being less impaired than that of both comorbid classes. In conflict with this hypothesis was that there was some specificity of cognitive deficits across classes.
Conclusions
The overlapping cognitive deficits may be used to further unravel the shared etiological underpinnings of ASD and ADHD, and the nonoverlapping deficits may indicate why some children develop ADHD despite their enhanced risk for ASD. The two subtypes of children with both ASD and ADHD behavior will most likely benefit from different clinical approaches.},

	abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

	abstract = {Recent research has indicated that autism is not a discrete disorder and that family members of autistic probands have an increased likelihood of exhibiting autistic symptoms with a wide range of severity, often below the threshold for a diagnosis of an autism spectrum disorder.To examine the distribution and genetic structure of autistic traits in the general population using a newly established quantitative measure of autistic traits, the Social Responsiveness Scale (formerly known as the Social Reciprocity Scale).The sample consisted of 788 pairs of twins aged 7 to 15 years, randomly selected from the pool of participants in a large epidemiologic study (the Missouri Twin Study). One parent of each pair of twins completed the Social Responsiveness Scale on each child. The data were subjected to structural equation modeling.Autistic traits as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale were continuously distributed and moderately to highly heritable. Levels of severity of autistic traits at or above the previously published mean for patients with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified were found in 1.4\% of boys and 0.3\% of girls. Structural equation modeling revealed no evidence for the existence of sex-specific genetic influences, and suggested specific mechanisms by which females may be relatively protected from vulnerability to autistic traits.These data indicate that the social deficits characteristic of autism spectrum disorders are common. Given the continuous distribution of these traits, it may be arbitrary where cutoffs are made between research designations of being "affected" vs "unaffected" with a pervasive developmental disorder. The genes influencing autistic traits appear to be the same for boys and girls. Lower prevalence (and severity) of autistic traits in girls may be the result of increased sensitivity to early environmental influences that operate to promote social competency.Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2003;60:524-530--{\textgreater}},

These criteria also provide the organising framework for much of the research focussing on these disorders. Study design, recruitment, analysis and theory are largely built on the assumption that diagnostic criteria reflect an underlying reality. However, there is growing concern that this assumption may not be a valid and that an alternative transdiagnostic approach may better serve our understanding of this large heterogeneous population of young people. This review draws on important developments over the past decade that have set the stage for much-needed breakthroughs in understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. We evaluate contemporary approaches to study design and recruitment, review the use of data-driven methods to characterise cognition, behaviour and neurobiology, and consider what alternative transdiagnostic models could mean for children and families. This review concludes that an overreliance on ill-fitting diagnostic criteria is impeding progress towards identifying the barriers that children encounter, understanding underpinning mechanisms and finding the best route to supporting them.},

We used data from a population-based developmental disabilities surveillance program for 8-year-olds in metropolitan Atlanta. From 1991–2010, prevalence estimates of ID and HL were stable with slight increases in VI prevalence. CP prevalence was constant from 1993–2010. The average annual increase in ASD prevalence was 9.3\% per year from 1996–2010, with a 269\% increase from 4.2 per 1,000 in 1996 to 15.5 per 1,000 in 2010. From 2000–2010, the prevalence of ID without ASD was stable; during the same time, the prevalence of ASD with and without co-occurring ID increased by an average of 6.6\% and 9.6\% per year, respectively. ASD prevalence increases were found among both males and females, and among nearly all racial/ethnic subgroups and levels of intellectual ability. Average annual prevalence estimates from 1991–2010 underscore the significant community resources needed to provide early intervention and ongoing supports for children with ID (13.0 per 1,000), CP, (3.5 per 1,000), HL (1.4 per 1,000) and VI (1.3 in 1,000), with a growing urgency for children with ASD.},

Results: Seventy-six percent of youth with ASD met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) criteria for ADHD. The clinical presentation of ADHD in youth with ASD was predominantly similar to its typical presentation including age at onset (3.5 ± 1.7 vs. 4.0 ± 1.9; p = .12), distribution of diagnostic subtypes, the qualitative and quantitative symptom profile, and symptom severity.

In the DSM-5, TS belongs to the “neurodevelopmental disorders” group, together with other neurodevelopmental conditions, frequently co-occurring. In this study, we searched the PubMed database using a combination of keywords associating TS and all neurodevelopmental diagnoses. From 1009 original reports, we identified 36 studies addressing TS and neurodevelopmental comorbidities. The available evidence suggests the following: (1) neurodevelopmental comorbidities in TS are the rule, rather than the exception; (2) attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent; (3) there is a continuum from a simple (TS + ADHD or/and learning disorder) to a more complex phenotype (TS + autism spectrum disorder). We conclude that a prompt diagnosis and a detailed description of TS comorbidities are necessary not only to understand the aetiological basis of neurodevelopmental disorders but also to address specific rehabilitative and therapeutic approaches.},

So far, empirical evidence on comorbidities of specific learning disorders in arithmetic, reading and spelling is scarce. Methods: Prevalence and gender ratios of specific learning disorders in arithmetic (AD), reading (RD), and spelling (SD) and their co-occurrence were assessed in a large (N = 2586) population-based sample of elementary school children and in a subsample of 293 children with at least one learning disorder (LD-sample). A questionnaire on familial transmission was given to a subsample of 256 parents of children with a learning disorder and 146 typically developing children. Results: The rates of deficits in arithmetic, reading, or spelling were four to five times higher in samples already experiencing marked problems in one academic domain compared to the full population. Thus, comorbidity of learning disorders was confirmed in a fairly standard school population. Rates of co-occurrence decreased for AD and RD, but not isolated SD when more stringent cutoff criteria were applied, suggesting that the comorbidity of arithmetic and spelling disorder may be more strongly biologically mediated than the comorbidity of arithmetic and reading disorder. We found a preponderance of girls with AD and boys with SD. These imbalanced gender ratios were especially marked for isolated problems, while for comorbid problems gender ratios were mostly balanced with the exception of deficits in arithmetic and reading (but not spelling) which were more typical for girls. The parental questionnaire provided evidence for disorder-specific familial transmission and co-segregation of arithmetic and literacy deficits. Conclusions: Comorbidities of learning disorders are not artificial. They are the result of a complex interplay between both general and disorder-specific aetiological factors.},

In this Introduction to a Special Section on Transdiagnostic Approaches to Psychopathology, we provide a narrative review of the transdiagnostic literature in order to situate the Special Section articles in context. We begin with a brief history of the diagnostic approach and outline several challenges it currently faces that arguably limit its applicability in current mental health science and practice. We then review several recent transdiagnostic approaches to classification, biopsychosocial processes, and clinical interventions, highlighting promising novel developments.

	abstract = {Background
Comorbidity with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is very common in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), worsening the developmental trajectory of ASD. The reported rates of ADHD in ASD vary widely. However, no meta-analysis has been conducted specifically to assess both the current and lifetime prevalence of ADHD in ASD. This study aims to fill in this gap.
Method
We searched the Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Embase databases for eligible articles published between January 1, 2000, and September 5, 2020. The risk of bias tool was used to assess the studies’ quality. Overall pooled estimates of the current and lifetime prevalence of ADHD in ASD were obtained using random-effects models. Study heterogeneity was examined by Q and I2 statistics.
Findings
A total of 63 articles were eventually included, of which 56 studies reported the current prevalence, and 13 studies reported the lifetime prevalence. The results revealed that the pooled current and lifetime prevalence rates of ADHD among ASD were 38.5 \% (95 \% CI 34.0–43.2) and 40.2 \% (95 \% CI 34.9–45.7), respectively. Our study also confirmed that age, intellectual disability, recruitment settings, and diagnostic criteria significantly influenced the current prevalence of ADHD in ASD.
Conclusion
ASD has considerable high current or lifetime prevalence rates of co-occurring ADHD. The findings demonstrate that clinicians should consider the high prevalence of ADHD in ASD and especially stay alert to possible ADHD diagnoses in school-age children and adolescents with ASD. Medical institutions should improve the assessment and tracking system of ADHD comorbidity in ASD and maximize the diagnostic accuracy for better treatment.},

In many cases, ADHD and ASD are comorbid. This study investigated the prevalence of sensory hyper- and hyposensitivity among adults with ADHD, controlling for autistic symptoms.Method:One hundred and sixteen adults diagnosed with ADHD completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile-NL (AASP-NL) and the Autism-spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaires. Prevalences of hyper- and hyposensitivity and autism-spectrum symptoms were compared to norm values. Multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to determine the association of autistic symptoms, age, gender, ADHD subtype, self-reported severity of ADHD symptoms, comorbid disorders, and use of medication on the sensory hypo- and hypersensitivity in adults with ADHD.Results:Adults with ADHD had more autistic symptoms, and they had both more hyper- and hyposensitivity compared to norm groups. This was especially apparent in the Activity level and Auditory sensory modalities. Sensory hypo- and hypersensitivity were both related to an increased ADHD score, even showing a dose-response relationship, but not to any autistic symptom or comorbid disorder. As much as 43\% of the females with ADHD reported sensory hypo- and/or hypersensitivity, compared to 22\% of the men.Conclusions:Sensory hypo- and hypersensitivity may be viewed as key features of adult ADHD, especially in females, regardless of any autistic symptoms. Future research should be directed at the implications of this sensory dysregulation for the understanding of the pathophysiology of (female) ADHD, and on the usefulness of assessment of atypical sensory profiles in the diagnostic procedure of ADHD in adults.},

Our sample included 120 children aged from 6 to 12 years divided into four groups: ASD alone (N = 43), ASD + ADHD (N = 18), ADHD alone (N = 28), and TD (N = 31). Atypical sensory processing was more frequent in ASD and/or ADHD than in TD, without a significant difference between ASD and ADHD. However, the variance analysis of attention problems revealed differences between the ADHD and ASD groups. Thus, the rate of atypical sensory processing was comparable between the ASD and ADHD groups, suggesting that further studies are needed to explore atypical SP in all neurodevelopmental disorders.},

Capitalizing on a population-based sample of twins, secondary aims included estimating the heritability of dyslexia and reporting on the measurement characteristics of the scale used to assess dyslexia. A telephone interview regarding symptoms of dyslexia and other NDPs was conducted with parents of 1,688 nine-year-old twins. The prevalence and the heritability of dyslexia were estimated at 8 and 52\%, respectively. The boy: girl ratio was 1.5:1. Results revealed that there was more than an eight-fold increase in (diagnostic proxy) NDPs prevalence in the dyslexia group as compared to typical readers. Quantitatively measured symptoms of inattention, oral language problems and atypical sensory perception significantly predicted dyslexia status in a multivariate analysis. By contrast, ASD-related inflexibility was inversely associated with dyslexia in the multivariate model. In sum, dyslexia often overlaps with other NDPs. The current study provides new knowledge supporting the position to move beyond isolated diagnostic categories into behavioural profiles of co-occurring problems when trying to understand the pattern of strengths and needs in individuals with dyslexia.},

	abstract = {We examined whether classifications based on reading performance are relevant to identify cognitively homogeneous subgroups of dyslexic children. Each of the 71 dyslexic participants was selected to have a mixed reading profile, i.e. poor irregular word and pseudo-word reading performance (accuracy and speed). Despite their homogeneous reading profile, the participants were found to split into four distinct cognitive subgroups, characterized by a single phonological disorder, a single visual attention span disorder, a double deficit or none of these disorders. The two subgroups characterized by single and contrasted cognitive disorders were found to exhibit a very similar reading pattern but more contrasted spelling performance (quantitative analysis). A qualitative analysis of the error types produced in reading and spelling provided some cues about the participants' underlying cognitive deficit. The overall findings disqualify subtyping based on reading profiles as a classification method to identify cognitively homogeneous subgroups of dyslexic children. They rather show an opaque relationship between the cognitive underpinnings of developmental dyslexia and their behavioral manifestations in reading and spelling. Future neuroimaging and genetic studies should take this issue into account since synthesizing over cognitively heterogeneous children would entail potential pitfalls.},

In addition to impaired reading development, individuals with dyslexia frequently exhibit behavioral deficits in perceptual adaptation. Here, we assessed neurophysiological adaptation to stimulus repetition in adults and children with dyslexia for a wide variety of stimuli, spoken words, written words, visual objects, and faces. For every stimulus type, individuals with dyslexia exhibited significantly diminished neural adaptation compared to controls in stimulus-specific cortical areas. Better reading skills in adults and children with dyslexia were associated with greater repetition-induced neural adaptation. These results highlight a dysfunction of rapid neural adaptation as a core neurophysiological difference in dyslexia that may underlie impaired reading development. Reduced neurophysiological adaptation may relate to prior reports of reduced behavioral adaptation in dyslexia and may reveal a difference in brain functions that ultimately results in a specific reading impairment.},

	abstract = {Competing theories of dyslexia posit that reading difficulties arise from impaired visual, auditory, phonological, or statistical learning mechanisms. Importantly, many theories posit that dyslexia reflects a cascade of impairments emanating from a single “core deficit”. Here we report two studies evaluating core deficit and multifactorial models. In Study 1, we use publicly available data from the Healthy Brain Network to test the accuracy of phonological processing measures for predicting dyslexia diagnosis and find that over 30\% of cases are misclassified (sensitivity = 66.7\%; specificity = 68.2\%). In Study 2, we collect a battery of psychophysical measures of visual motion processing and standardized measures of phonological processing in 106 school-aged children to investigate whether dyslexia is best conceptualized under a core-deficit model, or as a disorder with heterogenous origins. Specifically, by capitalizing on the drift diffusion model to analyze performance on a visual motion discrimination experiment, we show that deficits in visual motion processing, perceptual decision-making, and phonological processing manifest largely independently. Based on statistical models of how variance in reading skill is parceled across measures of visual processing, phonological processing, and decision-making, our results challenge the notion that a unifying deficit characterizes dyslexia. Instead, these findings indicate a model where reading skill is explained by several distinct, additive predictors, or risk factors, of reading (dis)ability.},

The Test of Sensory Function in Infants is a performance-based assessment and is suitable for infants aged 4 to 18 months. Studies evaluating the psychometric properties of these three assessments differed in the properties addressed and reported poor to adequate reliability. Interpretation Selecting the most appropriate and precise assessment to measure sensory processing function in infancy will depend on the specific components of sensory processing that need to be evaluated, infant age, and what other sources of information are available about the infant’s development.},

Still, most children with ADHD, dyslexia, and/or dyscalculia (86\%) had just one disorder. Cross-lagged modelling suggested that the trait correlations are due to genetic influences common to all traits, rather than causal influences.

The current exploratory study examines the reliability and validity of a novel parent-report measure which assesses sensory-sensitivities in both typically developing and non-typically developing children. This 42-item Parent-completed Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire (GSQ-P) has been adapted by us from an existing adult tool (Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire), and measures children’s hyper-sensitivities (sensory overload leading to avoidance-behaviours) and hypo-sensitivities (sensory dampening leading to seeking-behaviours) across seven different sense domains (visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, tactile, vestibular, proprioception). We validated this novel measure on the parents of 601 English children 6–11 years. Both the long version (42-items GSQ-P) and an additional reduced version (24-item rGSQ-P) significantly associated with children’s anxiety, behavioural difficulties, and ability to empathise. As expected, sensory sensitivities were invariant across age and gender, but non-typically developing children had significantly elevated scores compared to typically developing peers (in both GSQ-P and rGSQ-P). We also provide insight into the structure of sensory sensitivities in children, showing for the first time that hyper sensitivities cluster by sense (e.g., tactile questions cluster together; visual questions cluster together) whilst hypo sensitivities cluster by behaviour (e.g., a cluster of seeking-behaviours irrespective of sense; a cluster of sensory dampening irrespective of sense). We offer both instruments (GSQ-P and rGSQ-P) as free reliable measures for better understanding children’s sensitivities, for use in different circumstances depending on focus.},

Results In 2012, the recorded prevalence of ADHD was 1.06\% (95\% CI 1.03 to 1.09). Prevalence in the most deprived areas was double that of the least deprived areas (prevalence rate ratio 2.58 (95\% CI 2.36 to 2.83)), with a linear trend from least to most deprived areas across all regions in England.
Conclusions The low prevalence of ADHD in medical records may indicate considerable underdiagnosis. Higher rates in more disadvantaged areas indicate greater need for services in those areas.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one the most disabling developmental disorders, imposing an extremely high economic burden. Obtaining as accurate prevalence estimates as possible is crucial to guide governments in planning policies for identification and intervention for individuals with ASD and their relatives. The precision of prevalence estimates can be heightened by summative analyses of the data collected around the world. To that end, we conducted a three-level mixed-effects meta-analysis. A systematic search of the Web of Science, PubMed, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from 2000 up to 13 July 2020 was performed, and reference lists of previous reviews and existing databases of prevalence studies were screened. Overall, 79 studies were included in the analysis of ASD and 59–in the analysis of previously existing relevant diagnoses: 30 for Autistic Disorder (AD), 15 for Asperger Syndrome (AS), and 14 for Atypical Autism (AA) and Pervasive Developmental Disorder - Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS); these research reports covered the period from 1994 to 2019. Pooled prevalence estimates were 0.72\% (95\% CI = 0.61–0.85) for ASD, 0.25\% (95\% CI = 0.18–0.33) for AD, 0.13\% (95\% CI = 0.07–0.20) for AS, and 0.18\% (95\% CI = 0.10–0.28) for the combined group of AA and PDD-NOS. Estimates were higher (1) for the studies that used records-review surveillance rather than other designs; (2) in North America compared with other geographical regions; and (3) in high-income compared with lower-income countries. The highest prevalence estimates were registered in the USA. There was an increase in autism prevalence estimates over time.

	abstract = {How prevalent is dyslexia? A definitive answer to this question has been elusive because of the continuous distribution of reading performance and predictors of dyslexia and because of the heterogeneous nature of samples of poor readers. Samples of poor readers are a mixture of individuals whose reading is consistent with or expected based on their performance in other academic areas and in language, and individuals with dyslexia whose reading is not consistent with or expected based on their other performances. In the present article, we replicate and extend a new approach for determining the prevalence of dyslexia. Using model-based meta-analysis and simulation, three main results were found. First, the prevalence of dyslexia is better represented as a distribution that varies as a function of severity as opposed to any single-point estimate. Second, samples of poor readers will contain more expected poor readers than unexpected or dyslexic readers. Third, individuals with dyslexia can be found across the reading spectrum as opposed to only at the lower tail of reading performance. These results have implications for screening and identification, and for recruiting participants for scientific studies of dyslexia.},

Consequently, amygdala lesions cause a heterogeneous array of social and non-social deficits. Social behaviours are not localized to subdivisions of the amygdala even though the inputs and outputs that carry social signals are anatomically restricted to distinct subnuclear regions. This observation may be explained by the multidimensional response properties of the component neurons. Indeed, the multitudes of circuits that converge in the amygdala enlist the same subset of neurons into different ensembles that combine social and non-social elements into high-dimensional representations. These representations may enable flexible, context-dependent social decisions. As such, multidimensional processing may operate in parallel with subcircuits of genetically identical neurons that serve specialized and functionally dissociable functions. When combined, the activity of specialized circuits may grant specificity to social behaviours, whereas multidimensional processing facilitates the flexibility and nuance needed for complex social behaviour.},

Specific conclusions and hypotheses include: (1) the amygdala activates during exposure to aversive stimuli from multiple sensory modalities; (2) the amygdala responds to positively valenced stimuli, but these responses are less consistent than those induced by aversive stimuli; (3) amygdala responses are modulated by the arousal level, hedonic strength or current motivational value of stimuli; (4) amygdala responses are subject to rapid habituation; (5) the temporal characteristics of amygdala responses vary across stimulus categories and subject populations; (6) emotionally valenced stimuli need not reach conscious awareness to engage amygdala processing; (7) conscious hedonic appraisals do not require amygdala activation; (8) activation of the amygdala is associated with modulation of motor readiness, autonomic functions, and cognitive processes including attention and memory; (9) amygdala activations do not conform to traditional models of the lateralization of emotion; and (10) the extent and laterality of amygdala activations are related to factors including psychiatric status, gender and personality.

Yet it remains unclear to what extent the amygdala accounts for the social dysfunctions in ASD. Here, we review studies that investigate the relationship between amygdala function and ASD. We focus on studies that employ the same task and stimuli to directly compare people with ASD and patients with focal amygdala lesions, and we also discuss functional data associated with these studies. We show that the amygdala can only account for a limited number of deficits in ASD (primarily face perception tasks but not social attention tasks), a network view is, therefore, more appropriate. We next discuss atypical brain connectivity in ASD, factors that can explain such atypical brain connectivity, and novel tools to analyze brain connectivity. Lastly, we discuss new opportunities from multimodal neuroimaging with data fusion and human single-neuron recordings that can enable us to better understand the neural underpinnings of social dysfunctions in ASD. Together, the influential amygdala theory of autism should be extended with emerging data-driven scientific discoveries such as machine learning-based surrogate models to a broader framework that considers brain connectivity at the global scale.},

There is little evidence regarding the distinction between sensory over-responsivity and anxiety disorders in toddlers. This construct validity study examined differences between occupational therapists' and psychologists' judgments of behaviors as representing sensory processing disorders (SPD) versus anxiety disorders. Twenty-four occupational therapists and 25 psychologists completed a mailed survey, rating items from sensory and anxiety scales as representing sensory and/or anxiety disorders in toddlers, and analyzing cases of toddlers with these disorders. Occupational therapists were more likely to rate items as representing SPD than psychologists, and occupational therapists were more certain of the distinction of the sensory scales from anxiety. For the case designed to present a general anxiety disorder and the one designed to present sensory over-responsivity, more occupational therapists diagnosed as sensory over-responsive, while more psychologists diagnosed with a general anxiety disorder. The overlap in judgments of sensory over-responsivity and anxiety supports the notion that these constructs in part reflect different professionals' perspectives upon behaviors as well as the difficulty in distinguishing these constructs in toddlers.},

Here, we systematically review 75 articles investigating ADHD and ASD in young adult samples (mean ages 16–26) using cognitive tasks, with neural activity concurrently measured via electroencephalography (EEG) – the most accessible neuroimaging technology. The majority of studies focused on event-related potentials (ERPs), with some beginning to capitalise on oscillatory approaches. Overlapping and specific profiles for ASD and ADHD were found mainly for four neurocognitive domains: attention processing, performance monitoring, face processing and sensory processing. No studies in this age group directly compared both disorders or considered dual diagnosis with both disorders. Moving forward, understanding of ADHD, ASD and their overlap in young adulthood would benefit from an increased focus on cross-disorder comparisons, using similar paradigms and in well-powered samples and longitudinal cohorts.},

The magnitude of physiological responses to sensory challenge was a mediator variable between predictors (baseline arousal and attention) and outcomes (anxiety and physiological recovery). Behavioral SOR was correlated with anxiety but not with physiological variables.CONCLUSION. The intensity or magnitude of sensory responsivity mediates the relationship between baseline arousal and attention and outcome anxiety and physiologic recovery from sensory challenge. Behavioral tools used to measure SOR do not reflect physiological responsiveness; this mismatch warrants further investigation. SOR can prevent children from participating in the occupations of childhood; the greater the understanding of SOR, the more successful occupational therapy practitioners will be in developing effective interventions.},

However, the data in the scientific literature are not conclusive regarding the evolution of sensory features in children with ASD.

Methods. We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess sensory features in 34 children with ASD over time. The data were collected using a standardized assessment tool, the Sensory Profile. Results. Our analyses show that sensory features in children with ASD are stable from the age of three to six years. The stability of sensory scores is independent of correction by covariates, such as cognitive level and autism severity scores. Conclusions. Children with ASD have sensory features that persist from the time of diagnosis at the age of 3 to 4 years to school age. This persistence of sensory features from an early age underscores the need to support these children and their parents. Sensory features should be detected early and managed to improve functional and psychosocial outcomes.},

	abstract = {Plaguing humans for more than two millennia, manifest on every continent studied, and with more than one billion patients having an attack in any year, migraine stands as the sixth most common cause of disability on the planet. The pathophysiology of migraine has emerged from a historical consideration of the “humors” through mid-20th century distraction of the now defunct Vascular Theory to a clear place as a neurological disorder. It could be said there are three questions: why, how, and when? Why: migraine is largely accepted to be an inherited tendency for the brain to lose control of its inputs. How: the now classical trigeminal durovascular afferent pathway has been explored in laboratory and clinic; interrogated with immunohistochemistry to functional brain imaging to offer a roadmap of the attack. When: migraine attacks emerge due to a disorder of brain sensory processing that itself likely cycles, influenced by genetics and the environment. In the first, premonitory, phase that precedes headache, brain stem and diencephalic systems modulating afferent signals, light-photophobia or sound-phonophobia, begin to dysfunction and eventually to evolve to the pain phase and with time the resolution or postdromal phase. Understanding the biology of migraine through careful bench-based research has led to major classes of therapeutics being identified: triptans, serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists; gepants, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists; ditans, 5-HT1F receptor agonists, CGRP mechanisms monoclonal antibodies; and glurants, mGlu5 modulators; with the promise of more to come. Investment in understanding migraine has been very successful and leaves us at a new dawn, able to transform its impact on a global scale, as well as understand fundamental aspects of human biology.},

Age/IQ-matched youth aged 8–18 years (22 ANX; 30 ASD; 22 TD) experienced mildly aversive tactile and auditory stimuli during functional magnetic resonance imaging and then during skin conductance response (SCR) and heart rate (HR) measurements. Caregivers reported on participants' SOR and anxiety symptoms. ASD/ANX youth had elevated SOR and anxiety symptoms compared to TD. ASD/ANX youth showed similar, heightened brain responses to sensory stimulation compared to TD youth, but brain responses were more highly related to SOR symptoms in ASD youth and to anxiety symptoms in ANX youth. Across ASD/ANX youth, anxiety symptoms uniquely related to greater SCR whereas SOR uniquely related to greater HR responses to sensory stimulation. Behavioral and neurobiological over-responsivity to sensory stimulation was shared across diagnostic groups. However, findings support SOR and anxiety as distinct symptoms with unique biological mechanisms, and with different relationships to neural over-reactivity dependent on diagnostic group. Results indicate a need for targeted treatment approaches.},

	abstract = {Although maladaptive sensory processing has been observed among individuals with persistent heightened anxiety, it is unclear if difficulties processing sensory input early in life lead to anxiety disorders in adulthood and what mechanisms would drive this progression. In a transdiagnostic clinical sample of 231 adults characterized by heightened difficulties with emotion regulation, the present study sought to examine whether: (a) childhood sensory processing disorder (SPD) symptoms predict an increased probability of an anxiety disorder diagnosis in adulthood; and (b) difficulties with emotion regulation and adult SPD symptoms mediate this relationship. Participants were administered the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis-I disorders and self-reported symptoms of SPD experienced in childhood and adulthood. Results suggested that childhood SPD symptoms were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of a lifetime anxiety disorder diagnosis. Difficulties with emotion regulation fully mediated the relationship between childhood SPD and (a) any anxiety disorder in adulthood and, specifically (b) current generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Further, we found evidence for a candidate model accounting for the relationship among childhood SPD, adulthood SPD, difficulties with emotion regulation, and anxiety disorders in adulthood. Specifically, our data indicated that high symptoms of SPD in childhood may lead to high SPD symptoms in adulthood, which then lead to high emotion dysregulation, ultimately conferring vulnerability for an anxiety disorder diagnosis. Taken together, these findings provide preliminary evidence for how sensory processing impairments in childhood may relate to anxiety through difficulties regulating emotion regulation.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
          Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) refers to an exaggerated, intense, or prolonged behavioral response to ordinary sensory stimuli. The relationship of SOR to psychiatric disorders remains poorly understood. The current study examined the SOR construct within typically developing children with clinically significant anxiety, including the prevalence and course of SOR symptoms and relationship between SOR symptoms, demographic factors, and psychopathology.
          Method: 
          Children presenting at an anxiety specialty clinic (n = 88) completed a psychiatric diagnostic assessment, which included parent-report measures of SOR, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and global behavior and child-report measures of anxiety, depression, and OCD.
          Results: 
          Sensory over-responsivity symptoms were very common: 93.2\% were bothered by at least 1 tactile or auditory sensation, and the mean number of bothersome sensations was 9.2 (SD = 7.4). SOR symptoms were reported to be “moderately bothersome” on average and to onset at an early age. Sensory Over-Responsivity Inventory (SensOR) scores did not differ by psychiatric disorder diagnosis, but SensOR scores significantly correlated with measures of OCD and depression. Higher SensOR scores were associated with greater global impairment.
          Conclusion: 
          A high rate of SOR symptom occurrence was observed in this sample of children seeking anxiety treatment, suggesting that SOR may not be entirely independent of anxiety and may be closely associated with OCD. Future research on the validity and nosology of SOR using psychiatric samples is warranted.},

	abstract = {Autistic children are at greater risk of developing anxiety than their nonautistic peers. Sensory reactivity differences have been implicated as one of the risk factors. Specifically, sensory hyperreactivity has previously been linked to anxiety, including separation anxiety and specific phobia; however, minimal research has explored the influence of sensory hyporeactivity and seeking. Therefore, the present study examined the correlational relationship between sensory reactivity differences and anxiety subtypes in 41 autistic children aged between 3 and 14 years, using parent- and self-reported measures. We found positive correlations between sensory hyperreactivity and total anxiety, separation anxiety and physical injury fears. However, when controlling for autism traits, we found sensory hyperreactivity to be related to physical injury fears and specific phobia, and sensory hyporeactivity to be related to lower total and social anxiety. We found no significant relationships between sensory seeking and anxiety. These results indicate that sensory hyperreactivity and hyporeactivity might be implicated in specific anxiety symptomology. Our results also indicate minimal agreement between parent- and self-reported anxieties, which highlights the limitations of informant reports for anxiety and the pressing need for objective anxiety assessments for autistic children to be developed. Our findings have important implications for limiting the development of anxiety in autistic children and suggest that sensory reactivity differences should be considered when developing targeted interventions for certain anxiety disorders.

Lay Summary The present study found that when considering autism traits, greater sensory hyperreactivity, such as being oversensitive to sounds, was related to elevated phobia-related symptoms and sensory hyporeactivity, such as being under-responsive to touch, was related to lower total and social anxieties. Sensory seeking, such as a fascination with lights, was not related to anxiety. Our results have important implications for targeted anxiety interventions for autistic children. However, due to minimal agreement between the parent- and child-reported scores, developing more objective measures of anxiety would be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Social anxiety (SA) commonly co-occurs with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). It is conceivable that inherent socio-communication impairments, or their impact on social experiences, contribute to the development of SA.
Method
We undertook a systematic review to summarise English-language research about relationships between core ASD symptoms and SA in individuals with ASD.
Results
We searched five databases for studies published up until 28 July 2017. Of 1481 publications retrieved, 24 cross-sectional studies (described in 25 papers) met the inclusion criteria. Given methodological and clinical heterogeneity, data were synthesised narratively. SA, in individuals with ASD, was associated with poorer social skills and functioning, and reduced social motivation. There were associations between self-report SA and ASD measures, but a trend towards non-significant relationships between parent-ratings of these symptoms. Tentative evidence indicated that SA symptoms were not associated with restricted, repetitive behaviours or sensory sensitivities.
Conclusion
These findings support the notion that there are links between core ASD characteristics and SA. Further studies, employing qualitative and quantitative designs are needed to enhance understanding of causal, maintaining and protective mechanisms for SA in ASD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to determine if there were significant relationships between dysfunction in sensory modulation, symptoms of affective disorders, and adaptive behaviors in children and adolescents with Asperger's disorder between 6 and 17 years of age.
METHOD: Parents of 50 children and adolescents between 6 and 17 years of age diagnosed with Asperger's disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria completed the (a) Sensory Profile for children 6 to 10 years of age or the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile for adolescents 11 to 17 years of age; (b) the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System: Parent Version; (c) Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale Adapted Parent's Version; and (d) the Children's Depression Inventory Adapted Parent's Version. Descriptive statistics and the Pearson product-moment coefficient of correlation calculations were used for data analysis.
RESULTS: The results indicated that there were significantly strong positive correlations between sensory defensiveness and anxiety (r = .476, p = .000) in children and adolescents with Asperger's disorder. There were also significant relationships between symptoms of depression and hyposensitivity in the total group (r = .214, p = .05) and the older group (r = .492, p = .027). There were no significant relationships between depression and overall adaptive behavior (r = -.243, p = .089) or anxiety and overall adaptive behavior (r = -.108, p = .455). Significantly strong inverse relationships were found between the specific adaptive behaviors of functional academics, leisure, social skills, and symptoms of depression. Functional academics were also significantly inversely related to anxiety. Specifically, sensory hyper- and hypersensitivity were significantly inversely related to community use and social skills.
CONCLUSION: The data supports positive relationships between anxiety and sensory defensiveness in all age ranges and a relationship between depression and hyposensitivity in older children. Stronger inverse relationships were apparent between specific adaptive behaviors including: (a) symptoms of depression and functional academics, leisure, social skills; (b) anxiety and functional academics; and (c) both sensory hyper- and hyposensitivity and community use and social skills. In this study, as the symptoms of affective disorders increased in children and adolescents with Asperger's disorder, the functional performance in the adaptive behaviors of functional academics and social skills appeared to decrease. Performance in the adaptive behaviors of community use and socials skills appeared to decrease as symptoms of dysfunction in sensory modulation increase. Further research is necessary to determine the impact of treatment for dysfunction on sensory modulation on affective disorders and performance in specific adaptive behaviors.},

The present series of meta-analyses compares STAI-T scores among individuals with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and nonclinical comparison groups, as well as correlations with measures of anxiety and depressive symptom severity, in order to further examine discriminant and convergent validity. A total of 388 published studies (N = 31,021) were included in the analyses. Individuals with an anxiety disorder and those with a depressive disorder displayed significantly elevated scores on the STAI-T compared to nonclinical comparison groups. Furthermore, anxiety and depressive symptom severity were similarly strongly correlated with the STAI-T (mean r = .59 – .61). However, individuals with a depressive disorder had significantly higher STAI-T scores than individuals with an anxiety disorder (Hedges’s g = 0.27). Given these findings, along with previous factor analyses that have observed a depression factor on the STAI-T, describing the scale as a measure of ‘trait anxiety’ may be a misnomer. It is proposed that the STAI-T be considered a non-specific measure of negative affectivity rather than trait anxiety per se.},

A post-hoc model in which generalized anxiety functioned as the higher order factor for the other five factors described the data equally well. The reliability of the subscales was satisfactory to excellent. Evidence was found for both convergent and divergent validity: the measure correlated well with the parent report for internalizing symptoms, and lower with externalizing symptoms. Parent–child agreement ranged from 0.41 to 0.66 in the anxiety-disordered group, and from 0.23 to 0.60 in the control group.

	abstract = {Although approximately 25\% of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) exhibit an anxiety disorder, the comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety has been given less attention than comorbidity of ADHD and oppositional or conduct disorders. While it is true that comorbidity between ADHD and these externalizing disorders is more prevalent (approximately 50\%), the comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety deserves careful scrutiny in its own right in as much as this comorbidity may have important implications for etiology, assessment, and treatment. The primary purpose of the current review is to examine the methodological and substantive reasons for the comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety. Methodological areas include definitional issues and informant characteristics, while substantive areas include genetics, temperament, neurobiological and neuropsychological functioning, family influences, and temporal relations between ADHD and anxiety. The study of the comorbidity of ADHD and anxiety will be advanced through a more precise phenotypic classification of ADHD and the integration of research in adjacent fields such as temperament and genetics with current research on the psychopathology of ADHD.},

	abstract = {High rates of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety symptoms have been documented in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and have been associated with social and adaptive impairments. The study examined the frequency of clinically elevated ADHD and anxiety symptoms in an ASD group in comparison to a non-clinical group, compared the clinical presentation in the ASD group with and without ADHD and anxiety, assessed which child and familial variables add to the severity of Inattention, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (HI), and anxiety symptoms, and evaluated whether having clinically elevated ADHD and/or anxiety symptoms adds to the prediction of adaptive functioning in ASD. The study included 260 participants diagnosed with ASD (mean age: 7.5 ± 1.1), using standardized tests. The rate of clinically elevated ADHD and anxiety symptoms in ASD was 62.7 and 44.6\%, respectively, and symptom severity was significantly greater than the non-clinical sample. The entire population was divided into four subgroups: ASD alone, ASD+ADHD, ASD+anxiety, ASD+ADHD+anxiety, based on the parental behavioral questionnaire. The ASD alone group showed less severe autism symptoms in comparison to the other groups. Having ASD+ADHD symptoms was associated with greater impairments in socialization adaptive skills. Only the group with ASD+ADHD+anxiety was associated with poorer daily living adaptive skills. Regression analyses for prediction of ADHD and anxiety symptoms revealed that being a female and having lower adaptive skills scores predicted higher Inattention severity; being older, having better cognition, and more severe Restrictive Repetitive Behavior symptoms predicted more severe HI symptoms; being older and having more severe social impairments predicted higher anxiety scores. A regression analysis for the prediction of adaptive skills revealed that in addition to cognition and autism severity, the severity of Inattention symptoms added to the prediction of overall adaptive skills. In light of these findings, clinicians should diagnose these comorbidities in ASD early on, and provide effective interventions to reduce their negative impact on functioning, thereby improving outcome.},

Design  Retrospective cohort; individual record-l­inked data between Scotland’s 2011 Census and 9.5 years of National Records for Scotland death certification data. Setting  General community. Participants  Children and young people with intellectual disabilities living in Scotland aged 5–24 years, and an age-­ matched comparison group. Main outcome measures  Deaths up to 2020: age of death, age-­standardised mortality ratios (age-­SMRs); causes of death including cause-­specific age-­SMRs/sex-­ SMRs; and avoidable deaths.
Results  Death occurred in 260/7247 (3.6\%) children/ young people with intellectual disabilities (crude mortality rate=388/100 000 person-­years) and 528/156 439 (0.3\%) children/young people without intellectual disabilities (crude mortality rate=36/100 000 person-­years). SMRs for children/young people with versus those without intellectual disabilities were 10.7 for all causes (95\% CI 9.47 to 12.1), 5.17 for avoidable death (95\% CI 4.19 to 6.37), 2.3 for preventable death (95\% CI 1.6 to 3.2) and 16.1 for treatable death (95\% CI 12.5 to 20.8). SMRs were highest for children (27.4, 95\% CI 20.6 to 36.3) aged 5–9 years, and lowest for young people (6.6, 95\% CI 5.1 to 8.6) aged 20–24 years. SMRs were higher in more affluent neighbourhoods. Crude mortality incidences were higher for the children/young people with intellectual disabilities for most International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision chapters. The most common underlying avoidable causes of mortality for children/young people with intellectual disabilities were epilepsy, aspiration/reflux/choking and respiratory infection, and for children/young people without intellectual disabilities were suicide, accidental drug-­related deaths and car accidents.
Conclusion  Children with intellectual disabilities had significantly higher rates of all-­cause, avoidable, treatable},

	abstract = {There is growing evidence for an association between sensory reactivity and mental health in autism. This study set out to explore the relationship between sensory reactivity and mental health in preschool-aged autistic children. In total 54 preschool-aged children with an Autism Spectrum Condition took part. Sensory and mental health symptoms were obtained from the Sensory Processing Scale Inventory, Sensory Assessment of Neurodevelopmental Differences and the Behavioral Assessment System for Children–3. Correlational analyses showed a relationship between sensory reactivity and mental health symptoms in autistic preschool-aged children. Results also indicate divergence in sensory-mental health profiles between autistic preschool-aged children who are verbal and those who use few to no words. For the first time this study has revealed a relationship between sensory hyper-reactivity, as well as sensory seeking, and mental health symptoms outside of anxiety in autism. Of note, this relationship between sensory hyper-reactivity and internalizing symptoms appears to be driven by those with few to no words. This has implications for both research and clinical interventions, in particular for our understanding of the factors underlying mental health symptoms in different autistic phenotypes, as well as the possible role of functional communication in mitigating the development of mental health symptoms. Lay Summary The present study found that in autistic preschoolers, externalizing mental health symptoms, such as hyperactivity, are related to sensory seeking (seeking out or being fascinated with sensory stimuli), and internalizing mental health symptoms, such as depression, are related to sensory hyper-reactivity (sensitivity to sensory stimuli). Our results also show that whilst the relationships between externalizing symptoms and sensory seeking is seen across participants, the relationship between internalizing symptoms and sensory hyper-reactivity was only seen in autistic preschoolers who used few to no words. This has important implications for the assessment of sensory differences as part of more rigorous mental health assessments, especially in autistic people who use few to no words.},

	abstract = {Purpose To investigate health, mortality and healthcare inequalities experienced by people with intellectual disabilities, and autistic people, and their determinants; an important step towards identifying and implementing solutions to reduce inequalities. This paper describes the cohorts, record-linkages and variables that will be used.
Participants Scotland’s Census, 2011 was used to identify Scotland’s citizens with intellectual disabilities, and autistic citizens, and representative general population samples with neither. Using Scotland’s community health index, the Census data (demography, household, employment, long-term conditions) were linked with routinely collected health, death and healthcare data: Scotland’s register of deaths, Scottish morbidity data 06 (SMR06: cancer incidence, mortality, treatments), Prescribing Information System (identifying asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; angina/congestive heart failure/hypertension; peptic ulcer/reflux; constipation; diabetes; thyroid disorder; depression; bipolar disorders; anxiety/sleep; psychosis; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; epilepsy; glaucoma), SMR01 (general/acute hospital admissions and causes, ambulatory care sensitive admissions), SMR04 (mental health admissions and causes), Scottish Care Information–Diabetes Collaboration (diabetic care quality, diabetic outcomes), national bowel screening programme and cervical screening.
Findings to date Of the whole population, 0.5\% had intellectual disabilities, and 0.6\% were autistic. Linkage was successful for {\textgreater}92\%. The resultant e-cohorts include: (1) 22 538 people with intellectual disabilities (12 837 men and 9701 women), 4509 of whom are children {\textless}16 years, (2) 27 741 autistic people (21 390 men and 6351 women), 15 387 of whom are children {\textless}16 years and (3) representative general population samples with neither condition. Very good general health was reported for only 3389 (15.0\%) people with intellectual disabilities, 10 510 (38.0\%) autistic people, compared with 52.4\% general population. Mental health conditions were reported for 4755 (21.1\%) people with intellectual disabilities, 3998 (14.4\%) autistic people, compared with 4.2\% general population.
Future plans Analyses will determine the extent of premature mortality, causes of death, and avoidable deaths, profile of health conditions and cancers, healthcare quality and screening and determinants of mortality and healthcare.},

	abstract = {Background Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental conditions that vary in both etiology and phenotypic expression. Expressions of ASD characterized by a more severe phenotype, including autism with intellectual disability (ASD + ID), autism with a history of developmental regression (ASD + R), and minimally verbal autism (ASD + MV) are understudied generally, and especially in the domain of neuroimaging. However, neuroimaging methods are a potentially powerful tool for understanding the etiology of these ASD subtypes. Scope and methodology This review evaluates existing neuroimaging research on ASD + MV, ASD + ID, and ASD + R, identified by a search of the literature using the PubMed database, and discusses methodological, theoretical, and practical considerations for future research involving neuroimaging assessment of these populations. Findings There is a paucity of neuroimaging research on ASD + ID, ASD + MV, and ASD + R, and what findings do exist are often contradictory, or so sparse as to be ungeneralizable. We suggest that while greater sample sizes and more studies are necessary, more important would be a paradigm shift toward multimodal (e.g. imaging genetics) approaches that allow for the characterization of heterogeneity within etiologically diverse samples.},

We also assumed that demands on attentional control would be greater when cues were absent rather than present. According to attentional control theory (Eysenck, Derakshan, Santos, \& Calvo, 2007), anxiety impairs attentional control processes required to shift attention optimally within and between tasks. We predicted that there would be greater negative effects of high state anxiety in the task-switching condition than in the nontask-switching condition.

	abstract = {Attention is a fundamentally important cognitive process and is required to efficiently navigate the world. Whilst altered attentional processes have been frequently observed in autistic people the differences seen suggest that attentional processes are different, however not necessarily deficient. In fact, aspects of superior visual perceptual ability and enhanced perceptual capacity have frequently been reported. The goal of the present thesis was to extend our knowledge of enhanced perceptual capacity under the framework of the Load Theory and to extend the findings to more active components of attention. To address this aim, the first three empirical studies I conducted, assessed selective and executive attention in autism and in a fourth study I investigated the feasibility of a neurofeedback intervention. Specifically, in Chapter 2, I used behavioural markers of congruency effects to consider whether cognitive capacity would be increased for autistic people, analogous to the enhanced perceptual capacity previously reported. In Chapter 3, I investigated electrophysiological aspects of visual working memory capacity and filtering efficiency. The findings were further expanded upon in Chapter 4 by directly contrasting visual working memory capacity and perceptual capacity using electrophysiological markers. Finally, I sought to assess whether practical steps could be taken to address altered attention experienced by autistic adults. The feasibility of an online neurofeedback intervention was investigated to assess whether aspects of attention and mental health could be improved through the training programme (Chapter 5). The findings of the thesis were then summarised and further discussed, highlighting the contribution to the autism attention literature and offering practical recommendations to harness attentional strengths in autism.},

	abstract = {To date, multiple hypotheses have been proposed for the Scottish effect and, more specifically, Glasgow's high mortality rate and the associated Glasgow effect. Previous authors have highlighted the improbability of a single factor as responsible for this effect with seventeen possible hypotheses presented. These have ranged from socio-economic factors, lifestyle and cultural factors such as sectarianism, and political and economic factors. Although these may all be contributory factors to this paradox, the underpinning reasons for the observed effect remain relatively unexplained. In this paper, we suggest that the compounding effect of a unique blend of accumulating life stressors may predispose Scots, and particularly socially-disadvantaged Glaswegians, to a wide-range of health disorders. In short, a confluence of social, environmental, attitudinal and cultural stressors perhaps combine to negatively influence biological health. Future directions should consider the stress remediating role of physical activity, and the problems presented by barriers to participation in physical activity and exercise during key transitional stages of life.},

	doi = {10.1136/jech-2021-218192},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adults with intellectual disabilities (ID) may be at higher risk of COVID-19 death. We compared COVID-19 infection, severe infection, mortality, case fatality and excess deaths, among adults with, and without, ID.
METHODS: Adults with ID in Scotland's Census, 2011, and a 5\% sample of other adults, were linked to COVID-19 test results, hospitalisation data and deaths (24 January 2020-15 August 2020). We report crude rates of COVID-19 infection, severe infection (hospitalisation/death), mortality, case fatality; age-standardised, sex-standardised and deprivation-standardised severe infection and mortality ratios; and annual all-cause mortality for 2020 and 2015-2019.
FINDINGS: Successful linkage of 94.9\% provided data on 17 203 adults with, and 188 634 without, ID. Adults with ID had more infection (905/100 000 vs 521/100 000); severe infection (538/100 000 vs 242/100 000); mortality (258/100 000 vs 116/100 000) and case fatality (30\% vs 24\%). Poorer outcomes remained after standardisation: standardised severe infection ratio 2.61 (95\% CI 1.81 to 3.40) and mortality ratio 3.26 (95\% CI 2.19 to 4.32). These were higher at ages 55-64: 7.39 (95\% CI 3.88 to 10.91) and 19.05 (95\% CI 9.07 to 29.02), respectively, and in men, and less deprived neighbourhoods. All-cause mortality was slightly higher in 2020 than 2015-2019 for people with ID: standardised mortality ratio 2.50 (95\% CI 2.18 to 2.82) and 2.39 (95\% CI 2.28 to 2.51), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Adults with ID had more COVID-19 infections, and worse outcomes once infected, particularly adults under 65 years. Non-pharmaceutical interventions directed at formal and informal carers are essential to reduce transmission. All adults with ID should be prioritised for vaccination and boosters regardless of age.},

Both engagement and disengagement appear to be poorly conceptualised, with a lack of consensus on accepted and agreed definitions. Rates of disengagement from mental health services vary from 4 to 46\%, depending on the study setting, service type and definition of engagement used. Sociodemographic and clinical predictors of disengagement also vary, with only a few consistent findings, suggesting that such associations are complex and multifaceted. Most commonly reported associations of disengagement appear to be with sociodemographic variables including young age, ethnicity and deprivation; clinical variables such as lack of insight, substance misuse and forensic history; and service level variables such as availability of assertive outreach provision. Given the importance of continuity of care in serious mental disorders, there is a need for a consensual, validated and reliable measure of engagement which can be used to explore associations between patient, illness and service related variables and can inform service provision for difficult to reach patients.},

Results indicated that males and those with schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses were less likely to complete the intake assessment. Participants who reported more positive feelings about their family were more likely to engage in substance abuse treatment. Participants who were recently arrested were less likely to engage in treatment. Those who met criteria for current drug dependence were less likely to engage in treatment.

	abstract = {Background: A population segment of autistic adults are underidentified due, in part, to historic changes in criteria for diagnosing autism and diagnostic biases related to gender, socioeconomic status, and other individual characteristics such as intellectual functioning. Some of these individuals, described as the “lost generation,” may choose to self-diagnose. Although little is known about this population, it is possible that they share similar self-conceptualizations or internalized stigma as their diagnosed counterparts. This study reports on the structural validity of the Autism Spectrum Identity Scale (ASIS) with individuals diagnosed and self-diagnosed with autism and compares the demographic characteristics, stigma, self-concept, and quality of life of these two groups.

Methods: Over 1000 adults diagnosed (n = 893) or self-diagnosed (n = 245) with autism were recruited through organizations serving the autism community to participate in a nationally distributed online survey that included demographic questions and measures for stigma, self-concept, quality of life, and well-being. The diagnosed data set was randomly split with exploratory factor analysis performed on a training data set. Split-half cross-validation was used to predict the factor structure of the holdout data set. Then, the full diagnosed data set structure was used to determine the generalizability of the factor structure to the self-diagnosed data set. The diagnosed and self-diagnosed were also compared for differences in gender, age, employment status, diagnostic term preference, and factors of self-concept (autism identity and self-esteem), stigma, and quality of life.

Results: Factor analysis of diagnosed participants yielded a four-factor structure, consistent with previous research, with strong split-sample cross-validation and good internal consistency. Factor predictions of the self-diagnosed data set from the diagnosed data set ranged from 0.97 to 1.00 with similar internal consistency. Self-diagnosed participants were more likely to be older, women, or employed and less likely to be students or prefer the term “autism” than those with an autism diagnosis. The groups were remarkably similar in reported stigma, self-esteem, quality of life, and in ASIS factors; both groups reported lower quality of life than the general population.

Conclusions: The ASIS demonstrated the same internal structure with both the diagnosed and self-diagnosed samples. The profile of self-diagnosed participants matches the profile hypothesized for the “lost generation” and others at risk of being underidentified for autism. Both populations appear to be similarly struggling with employment, stigma, and quality of life. Future research should examine whether self-diagnosed individuals meet criteria for autism or could benefit from interventions, programs, or services serving autism communities.},

	abstract = {Sensory processing differences have long been associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and they have recently been added to the diagnostic criteria for the disorder. The focus on sensory processing in ASD research has increased substantially in the last decade. This research has been approached from two different perspectives: the first focuses on characterizing the symptoms that manifest in response to real world sensory stimulation, and the second focuses on the neural pathways and mechanisms underlying sensory processing. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the empirical literature on sensory processing in ASD from the last decade, including both studies characterizing sensory symptoms and those that investigate neural response to sensory stimuli. We begin with a discussion of definitions to clarify some of the inconsistencies in terminology that currently exist in the field. Next, the sensory symptoms literature is reviewed with a particular focus on developmental considerations and the relationship of sensory symptoms to other core features of the disorder. Then, the neuroscience literature is reviewed with a focus on methodological approaches and specific sensory modalities. Currently, these sensory symptoms and neuroscience perspectives are largely developing independently from each other leading to multiple, but separate, theories and methods, thus creating a multidisciplinary approach to sensory processing in ASD. In order to progress our understanding of sensory processing in ASD, it is now critical to integrate these two research perspectives and move toward an interdisciplinary approach. This will inevitably aid in a better understanding of the underlying biological basis of these symptoms and help realize the translational value through its application to early identification and treatment. The review ends with specific recommendations for future research to help bridge these two research perspectives in order to advance our understanding of sensory processing in ASD.},

	abstract = {Background
Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Rett Syndrome (RTT) are two extensively researched
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). It is important that researchers and other stakeholders
have access to up-to-date information and can make decisions based on the highest quality
evidence.
Systematic review is a method used to summarise evidence and assess its quality. However,
they are time-consuming to conduct and often results are out-of-date by the time of
publication. Living evidence summaries are a new type of resource which provide an up-to-
date, searchable database of research on a given topic. They build on systematic review
methods but use automation technology, such as artificial intelligence, to keep up with new
research as it is published, providing real-time overviews.
Aims
84
To inform the development of a living evidence summary of fundamental NDD research, our
project aims to (1) identify previously conducted systematic reviews of fundamental FXS or RTT
research, (2) summarise their focus, and (3) assess their reporting quality.
Methods and analysis
We will search three bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science) to identify
relevant systematic reviews. We will not restrict searches by publication date or language.
Two independent reviewers will screen the search results to ensure relevance. We will then
provide a descriptive summary of each reviews’ scope and score each reviews’ reporting quality
using an adapted version of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses) checklist. Reporting quality is used as a surrogate to measure how well each
review was conducted.
Impact
This meta-research project will help us understand how well previous systematic reviews of
fundamental NDD research were conducted, and inform the development of a living evidence
summary. Once completed, this resource will provide researchers and other stakeholders with
an up-to-date overview of research and an indication of the overall evidence},

	abstract = {Autism is a severe neurobehavioral syndrome, arising largely as an inherited disorder, which can arise from several diseases. Despite recent advances in identifying some genes that can cause autism, its underlying neurological mechanisms are uncertain. Autism is best conceptualized by considering the neural systems that may be defective in autistic individuals. Recent advances in understanding neural systems that process sensory information, various types of memories and social and emotional behaviors are reviewed and compared with known abnormalities in autism. Then, specific genetic abnormalities that are linked with autism are examined. Synthesis of this information leads to a model that postulates that some forms of autism are caused by an increased ratio of excitation/inhibition in sensory, mnemonic, social and emotional systems. The model further postulates that the increased ratio of excitation/inhibition can be caused by combinatorial effects of genetic and environmental variables that impinge upon a given neural system. Furthermore, the model suggests potential therapeutic interventions.},

	abstract = {Background:
                  Mentally-generated soothing imagery is a therapeutic technique to support mental wellbeing, but some individuals may require support using externally presented stimuli. Project Soothe was launched to collect soothing images using a citizen science approach. This online pilot study evaluated the first 575 soothing images collected, examining: 1) if the images were perceived to be soothing; 2) if viewing the images had a positive impact on mood; and 3) if mood effects were influenced by individual differences in age, gender and depressive symptoms.
            
            
              Methods:
                       We recruited 1152 participants (13 – 79 years, M = 35.62, SD = 14.60; 77\% female). Participants were randomly allocated to one of 23 sets, each containing 25 images (n = 50 per set) and asked to rate their emotional response (soothed, excited, and anxious) to each image. Participants also reported their mood states pre- and post-viewing the images (using the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule – Short Form).
            
            
              Results:
                         Project Soothe images were rated to be significantly more soothing than anxiety- or excitement-inducing. Further, viewing 25 images was significantly associated with an increase in positive affect and decrease in negative affect. These effects were associated with age and depressive symptoms, with older individuals and those with lower depressive symptoms being associated with more positive changes in mood.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              This pilot study provides preliminary evidence that these soothing images can promote positive mood changes. Further work can now replicate these findings in larger-scale studies with comparison groups and extended outcome variables. The images and associated data have been made available in a data repository (OSF) as a free resource for researchers and practitioners. It is hoped that these images can be developed into useful therapeutic resources.},

	abstract = {Why do we watch and like horror films? Despite a century of horror film making and entertainment, little research has examined the human motivation to watch fictional horror and how horror film influences individuals’ behavioral, cognitive, and emotional responses. This review provides the first synthesis of the empirical literature on the psychology of horror film using multi-disciplinary research from psychology, psychotherapy, communication studies, development studies, clinical psychology, and media studies. The paper considers the motivations for people’s decision to watch horror, why people enjoy horror, how individual differences influence responses to, and preference for, horror film, how exposure to horror film changes behavior, how horror film is designed to achieve its effects, why we fear and why we fear specific classes of stimuli, and how liking for horror develops during childhood and adolescence. The literature suggests that (1) low empathy and fearfulness are associated with more enjoyment and desire to watch horror film but that specific dimensions of empathy are better predictors of people’s responses than are others; (2) there is a positive relationship between sensation-seeking and horror enjoyment/preference, but this relationship is not consistent; (3) men and boys prefer to watch, enjoy, and seek our horror more than do women and girls; (4) women are more prone to disgust sensitivity or anxiety than are men, and this may mediate the sex difference in the enjoyment of horror; (5) younger children are afraid of symbolic stimuli, whereas older children become afraid of concrete or realistic stimuli; and (6) in terms of coping with horror, physical coping strategies are more successful in younger children; priming with information about the feared object reduces fear and increases children’s enjoyment of frightening television and film. A number of limitations in the literature is identified, including the multifarious range of horror stimuli used in studies, disparities in methods, small sample sizes, and a lack of research on cross-cultural differences and similarities. Ideas for future research are explored.},

However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the 'gold standard' for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

	abstract = {One account of the early versus late selection debate in attention proposes that perceptual load determines the locus of selection. Attention selects stimuli at a late processing level under low-load conditions but selects stimuli at an early level under high-load conditions. Despite the successes of perceptual load theory, a noncircular definition of perceptual load remains elusive. We investigated the factors that influence perceptual load by using manipulations that have been studied extensively in visual search, namely target–distractor similarity and distractor–distractor similarity. Consistent with previous work, search was most efficient when targets and distractors were dissimilar and the displays contained homogeneous distractors; search became less efficient when target–distractor similarity increased irrespective of display heterogeneity. Importantly, we used these same stimuli in a typical perceptual load task that measured attentional spillover to a task-irrelevant flanker. We found a strong correspondence between search efficiency and perceptual load; stimuli that generated efficient searches produced flanker interference effects, suggesting that such displays involved low perceptual load. Flanker interference effects were reduced in displays that produced less efficient searches. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that search difficulty, as measured by search intercept, has little bearing on perceptual load. We conclude that rather than be arbitrarily defined, perceptual load might be defined by well-characterized, continuous factors that influence visual search.

The suggestion is that successful selection depends on the perceptual demands imposed by the task-relevant information. However, less research has addressed the question of whether the same principles hold in audition and, to date, the existing literature provides a mixed picture.

This paper presents two experiments which aimed to examine whether Virtual Reality (VR) technology can be used to recreate the synaesthetic experience. There is a lack of research in this area, with most studies focussing primarily on synaesthetic colors. Experiment 1 aimed to build on previous research by using not only a traditional color-picker but also VR to capture a more nuanced picture of synaesthetic perception. A multiple case study design was used to examine the experiences of six participants in detail. Data gathering took place via Zoom. During the initial data-gathering session, participants used a color-picker to provide grapheme-color associations. After this session, some of the participants’ synaesthetic experiences were recreated using a VR-by-proxy approach. Results indicated that VR is capable of capturing elements of synaesthetic perception that other methods have been unable to, such as texture, small degrees of movement, and 3D structure. Experiment 2 expanded upon these findings by moving beyond the VR-by-proxy approach and asking three participants to recreate their own audiovisual synaesthetic associations in the VR environment. Inductive Thematic Analysis was used to analyze the results of this experiment. The potential of expanding this technique to other forms of perceptual diversity is discussed.},

Healthy undergraduate students (N = 106) completed questionnaires, an attentional bias dot-probe task, and an interpretation bias task before and after ABM, one of four ABM versions that differed in training direction (S+A+, S-A+, S+A-, S-A-), and pain outcomes using the cold pressor task. Those trained towards affective pain words were found to have a greater pain threshold but also greater distress at tolerance. However, mechanisms of change could not be established, as ABM did not affect attentional or interpretation bias, even though changes in attentional bias were associated with pain outcomes. These findings provide partial support for the threat interpretation model and highlight the utility of affective pain ABM, although further investigation of causal mechanisms is warranted.},

Additional portfolio analyses examine temporal trends in funded RDoC-relevant grants, publications and citations, and research training opportunities. Reflecting on how RDoC has influenced the focus of grant applications, we highlight examples from research on Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), childhood irritability, and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

By contrast, for the most serious of mental illnesses, including dementia, autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, we argue that RDoC is conceptually flawed. RDoC conflates variation along dimensional axes of normal function with quantitative measurements of disease phenotypes and with the occurrence of diseases in overlapping clusters or spectra. This moves away from the disease model of major mental illness. Further, RDoC imposes a top-down approach to research. We argue that progress in major mental illness research will be more rapid with a bottom-up approach, starting with the discovery of etiological factors, proceeding to investigation of pathogenic pathways, including use of cell and animal models, and leading to a refined nosology and novel, targeted treatments.},

          Big data approaches in mental health research hold great promise to advance research and support for neurologically diverse populations. The Risk, Resilience and Developmental Diversity in Mental Health (R2D2-MH) project moves from risk-focused studies toward understanding and promoting resilience, and from a diagnosis-based approach to a developmental diversity approach that defines well-being across the lifespan. Here, we present a proof-of-principle in R2D2-MH demonstrating that the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) can facilitate content harmonization in mental health research to generate big data compatible with several contemporary approaches in psychiatry. Transforming data through the ICF classification system allowed data collected with a wide range of instruments across modalities and diverse populations to be harmonized under the widely accepted WHO framework. Data harmonized using the ICF provides novel opportunities for large-scale data analyses that may be more capable of capturing diversity, aligning with more transdiagnostic and neurodiversity-affirmative ways of understanding data.},

	abstract = {People exposed to more unfavourable social circumstances are more vulnerable to poor mental health over their life course, in ways that are often determined by structural factors which generate and perpetuate intergenerational cycles of disadvantage and poor health. Addressing these challenges is an imperative matter of social justice. In this paper we provide a roadmap to address the social determinants that cause mental ill health. Relying as far as possible on high-quality evidence, we first map out the literature that supports a causal link between social determinants and later mental health outcomes. Given the breadth of this topic, we focus on the most pervasive social determinants across the life course, and those that are common across major mental disorders. We draw primarily on the available evidence from the Global North, acknowledging that other global contexts will face both similar and unique sets of social determinants that will require equitable attention. Much of our evidence focuses on mental health in groups who are marginalized, and thus often exposed to a multitude of intersecting social risk factors. These groups include refugees, asylum seekers and displaced persons, as well as ethnoracial minoritized groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) groups; and those living in poverty. We then introduce a preventive framework for conceptualizing the link between social determinants and mental health and disorder, which can guide much needed primary prevention strategies capable of reducing inequalities and improving population mental health. Following this, we provide a review of the evidence concerning candidate preventive strategies to intervene on social determinants of mental health. These interventions fall broadly within the scope of universal, selected and indicated primary prevention strategies, but we also briefly review important secondary and tertiary strategies to promote recovery in those with existing mental disorders. Finally, we provide seven key recommendations, framed around social justice, which constitute a roadmap for action in research, policy and public health. Adoption of these recommendations would provide an opportunity to advance efforts to intervene on modifiable social determinants that affect population mental health.},

The National Institute of Mental Health’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) Positive Valence System (PVS) domain was used as an overarching framework. The objectives were to determine which component operations of reward processing may be atypical in ASD and consequently postulate a heuristic model of reward processing in ASD that could be evaluated with future research. 34 studies were identified from the Embase, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases and included in the review using guidelines from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (also known as PRISMA guidelines). The extant literature suggested potential relationships between social symptoms of ASD and PVS sub-constructs of reward anticipation, probabilistic and reinforcement learning, reward prediction error, reward (probability), delay, and effort as well as between restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests (RRBIs) and PVS-sub constructs of initial response to reward, reward anticipation, reward (probability), delay, and effort. However, these findings are limited by a sparse and mixed literature for some sub-constructs. We put forward a developmentally informed heuristic model that posits how these component reward processes may be implicated in early ASD behaviors as well as later emerging and more intransigent symptoms. Future research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the proposed model.},

	abstract = {Background The literature on the prevalence of mental disorders affecting children and adolescents has expanded significantly over the last three decades around the world. Despite the field having matured significantly, there has been no meta-analysis to calculate a worldwide-pooled prevalence and to empirically assess the sources of heterogeneity of estimates. Methods We conducted a systematic review of the literature searching in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for prevalence studies of mental disorders investigating probabilistic community samples of children and adolescents with standardized assessments methods that derive diagnoses according to the DSM or ICD. Meta-analytical techniques were used to estimate the prevalence rates of any mental disorder and individual diagnostic groups. A meta-regression analysis was performed to estimate the effect of population and sample characteristics, study methods, assessment procedures, and case definition in determining the heterogeneity of estimates. Results We included 41 studies conducted in 27 countries from every world region. The worldwide-pooled prevalence of mental disorders was 13.4\% (CI 95\% 11.3–15.9). The worldwide prevalence of any anxiety disorder was 6.5\% (CI 95\% 4.7–9.1), any depressive disorder was 2.6\% (CI 95\% 1.7–3.9), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was 3.4\% (CI 95\% 2.6–4.5), and any disruptive disorder was 5.7\% (CI 95\% 4.0–8.1). Significant heterogeneity was detected for all pooled estimates. The multivariate metaregression analyses indicated that sample representativeness, sample frame, and diagnostic interview were significant moderators of prevalence estimates. Estimates did not vary as a function of geographic location of studies and year of data collection. The multivariate model explained 88.89\% of prevalence heterogeneity, but residual heterogeneity was still significant. Additional meta-analysis detected significant pooled difference in prevalence rates according to requirement of funcional impairment for the diagnosis of mental disorders. Conclusions Our findings suggest that mental disorders affect a significant number of children and adolescents worldwide. The pooled prevalence estimates and the identification of sources of heterogeneity have important implications to service, training, and research planning around the world.},

Electronic databases, reference lists, review articles and monographs were searched and experts then contacted to identify missing studies. Substantive and methodological factors associated with inter-study variability were identified through meta-regression analyses and the global prevalence of anxiety disorders was calculated adjusting for study methodology.ResultsThe prevalence of anxiety disorders was obtained from 87 studies across 44 countries. Estimates of current prevalence ranged between 0.9\% and 28.3\% and past-year prevalence between 2.4\% and 29.8\%. Substantive factors including gender, age, culture, conflict and economic status, and urbanicity accounted for the greatest proportion of variability. Methodological factors in the final multivariate model (prevalence period, number of disorders and diagnostic instrument) explained an additional 13\% of variance between studies. The global current prevalence of anxiety disorders adjusted for methodological differences was 7.3\% (4.8–10.9\%) and ranged from 5.3\% (3.5–8.1\%) in African cultures to 10.4\% (7.0–15.5\%) in Euro/Anglo cultures.ConclusionsAnxiety disorders are common and the substantive and methodological factors identified here explain much of the variability in prevalence estimates.

Furthermore, there has not been a research priority-setting exercise specifically with autistic people in Scotland, where there are unique cultural, political and social contexts. Using a community-based participatory design, we aimed to identify the research priorities of autistic adults living in Scotland. Autistic and non-autistic researchers designed and conducted a survey where 225 autistic adults rated and ranked research topics in order of importance and provided qualitative feedback on issues and questions important to them. The top five research priorities were mental health/well-being, identification and diagnosis of autistic people, support services, knowledge and attitudes towards autistic people and issues impacting autistic women. There were differences in priorities according to different intersections of identity, and qualitative responses indicated a desire for research to focus on support and understanding. The bottom three priorities concerned genetics, treatments and interventions and causes. These findings emphasise the need to address the gap between what autism research focuses on and the everyday lives of autistic people.
Lay abstract
Although research has the potential to improve autistic people’s lives, lots of funding goes towards research looking at topics which autistic people say has little impact in their everyday lives. Autistic people’s lives can be different depending on where they live, and Scotland is a unique country in many ways. We wanted to find out which topics autistic people in Scotland want to see research on. Our team of autistic and non-autistic researchers (including university-based and community researchers) created a survey where 225 autistic adults rated and ranked the importance of possible research topics and shared their thoughts on what topics mattered to them. The five most important topics were mental health and well-being, identifying and diagnosing autistic people, support services (including healthcare and social care), non-autistic people’s knowledge and attitudes and issues impacting autistic women. The three least important topics were genetics or biological aspects of autism, autism treatments/interventions and causes of autism. Our findings indicate that autistic people in Scotland want research to focus on things that matter to their day-to-day lives. Also, the Scottish government says they will be listening to autistic people in their latest policy plans, and we believe that considering autistic people’s research priorities is an important part of this. Our findings also add to growing calls for change to happen in how and what autism researchers do research on.},

We defined ID by attendance at a special school or registered diagnosis and obtained data on criminal convictions and injuries or deaths due to assaults from nationwide registers until end of 2013.ResultsCompared to people without ID, autism or ADHD, men and women with mild or moderate/severe ID and comorbid ADHD had elevated risks of violent crimes [range of hazard ratios (HRs) 4.4–10.4] and assault victimization (HRs 2.0–7.7). Women with mild ID without comorbidities or with comorbid autism also had elevated risks of violent crimes and victimization (HRs 1.8–4.6) compared to women without ID, autism or ADHD. The relative risks of sexual offending and victimization were elevated in men and women with ID without comorbidities (HRs 2.6–12.7). The highest risks for sexual offending in men (HRs 9.4–11.0) and for sexual assault victimization in women (HRs 11.0–17.1) related to ID and comorbid ADHD.ConclusionsThe elevated risk of violent offending and assault victimization in people with ID is largely explained by comorbid ADHD, whereas ID is independently associated with sexual crimes and victimization, even though absolute risks are low.},

With 4.4 million active (alive, currently registered) patients meeting quality criteria, approximately 6.9\% of the UK population are included and patients are broadly representative of the UK general population in terms of age, sex and ethnicity. General practitioners are the gatekeepers of primary care and specialist referrals in the UK. The CPRD primary care database is therefore a rich source of health data for research, including data on demographics, symptoms, tests, diagnoses, therapies, health-related behaviours and referrals to secondary care. For over half of patients, linkage with datasets from secondary care, disease-specific cohorts and mortality records enhance the range of data available for research. The CPRD is very widely used internationally for epidemiological research and has been used to produce over 1000 research studies, published in peer-reviewed journals across a broad range of health outcomes. However, researchers must be aware of the complexity of routinely collected electronic health records, including ways to manage variable completeness, misclassification and development of disease definitions for research.},

	abstract = {Record linkage is increasingly used to expand the information available for public health research. An understanding of record linkage methods and the relevant strengths and limitations is important for robust analysis and interpretation of linked data. Here, we describe the approach used by Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) to link primary care data to other patient level datasets, and the potential implications of this approach for CPRD data analysis. General practice electronic health record software providers separately submit de-identified data to CPRD and patient identifiers to NHS Digital, excluding patients who have opted-out from contributing data. Data custodians for external datasets also send patient identifiers to NHS Digital. NHS Digital uses identifiers to link the datasets using an 8-stage deterministic methodology. CPRD subsequently receives a de-identified linked cohort file and provides researchers with anonymised linked data and metadata detailing the linkage process. This methodology has been used to generate routine primary care linked datasets, including data from Hospital Episode Statistics, Office for National Statistics and National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. 10.6 million (M) patients from 411 English general practices were included in record linkage in June 2018. 9.1M (86\%) patients were of research quality, of which 8.0M (88\%) had a valid NHS number and were eligible for linkage in the CPRD standard linked dataset release. Linking CPRD data to other sources improves the range and validity of research studies. This manuscript, together with metadata generated on match strength and linkage eligibility, can be used to inform study design and explore potential linkage-related selection and misclassification biases.},

          The study summarizes supportive epidemiological data regarding the true co-occurrence (comorbidity) and course of mental disorders in children with intellectual disability/intellectual developmental disorders (ID/IDD) across the lifespan.
          Recent findings 
          Published studies involving representative populations of children and adolescents with ID/IDD have demonstrated a three to four-fold increase in prevalence of co-occurring mental disorders. The effect of age, sex, and severity (mild, moderate, severe, and profound) and socioeconomic status on prevalence is currently not clearly understood. To date there are no prevalence estimates of co-occurring mental disorders in youth identified using the new DSM-5 (and proposed ICD-11) definition of ID/IDD using measures of intellectual functions and deficits in adaptive functioning with various severity levels defined on the basis of adaptive functioning, and not intellectual quotient scores.
          Summary 
          The true relationship between two forms of morbidity remains complex and causal relationships that may be true for one disorder may not apply to another. The new conceptualization of ID/IDD offers a developmentally better informed psychobiological approach that can help distinguish co-occurrence of mental disorders within the neurodevelopmental section with onset during the developmental period as well as the later onset of other mental disorders.},

Little is known about nature of the relationship between cognitive development and psychopathology in very young children. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the first two waves of the UK’s Millennium Cohort Study (n = 11,389) and the first two waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 4,606). Results: Two- to three-year- old children with developmental delay show significantly higher rates of emotional and behavioural difficulties than their peers. These differences appear to reflect a general association between cognitive performance and emotional/behavioural difficulties in the bottom half of the ability spectrum and threshold-based discontinuities within the bottom 3\% of the distribution. In the UK, but to a much lesser extent in Australia, higher rates of emotional and behavioural difficulties among children with developmental delay may be partially attributed to greater risk of exposure to adverse socio-economic circumstances. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential value of targeted preventative interventions for young children with developmental delay.},

The population comprised 155 intellectually disabled children. Medical information was obtained from case files, which indicated that a psychiatric disorder had previously been diagnosed for 11\% of patients. A careful re-examination of the case files revealed a psychiatric disorder for 33\%. The criteria of a psychiatric ICD-10 diagnosis were fulfilled by 23\%, and a further 10\% had an unspecified mental disorder. The most common diagnoses were pervasive developmental disorders and hyperkinetic disorders. The former were less common among children with mild intellectual disability. In conclusion, about one-third of children with intellectual disability have a psychiatric disorder which needs to be taken into account in treatment.},

Aims To measure the number of referrals to the Service from 1983 to 2001 and identify trends. Methods Data were recorded on 752 new referrals using the assessment and information rating profile. Diagnoses according to the International Classification of Diseases (10th edition) were made by two psychiatrists. Referrals for a one off consultation or assessment, or with an IQ {\textgreater} 70 were excluded from analysis. Results Over time more non-white clients and more clients with mild ID were referred. More referrals were made in later years, and a greater proportion came from primary care. Later referrals were also more likely to have a psychiatric diagnosis than those in earlier years. Conclusion Significant trends in referrals were identified, which may be explained by various external factors.},

We believe that some influential accounts of autism rest on a questionable assumption that many of its behavioral characteristics indicate a lack of social interest – an assumption that is flatly contradicted by the testimony of many autistic people themselves. In this article, we challenge this assumption by describing alternative explanations for four such behaviors: (a) low levels of eye contact, (b) infrequent pointing, (c) motor stereotypies, and (d) echolalia. The assumption that autistic people's unusual behaviors indicate diminished social motivation has had profound and often negative effects on the ways they are studied and treated. We argue that understanding and supporting autistic individuals will require interrogating this assumption, taking autistic testimony seriously, considering alternative explanations for unusual behaviors, and investigating unconventional – even idiosyncratic – ways in which autistic individuals may express their social interest. These steps are crucial, we believe, for creating a more accurate, humane, and useful science of autism.},

Employing an interpretivist approach facilitated the investigation of potential contributory factors to these lived experiences in order to inform further research regarding both this topic, and service provision for adults on the autism spectrum. The project involved a thematic analysis of issues of the magazine Asperger United (AU). Four broad main themes were identified: meeting personal needs, living with the consequences of an ‘othered’ identity, connection and recognition, and relationships and advocacy. Autistic adults reported many barriers to feeling that they belonged in a number of social spaces and the detrimental effect this had on their wellbeing. Fundamental to positive narratives of wellbeing, were feelings of connection and recognition from others and positive accepting relationships, with autistic-led spaces, particularly the Autscape conference, being frequently cited as of central significance in increasing feelings of wellbeing and belonging.

We present a transactional account of development in which the misperceptions (and consequent behaviour) of the neurotypical majority influences the perceptions and behaviour of autistic people such that they become increasingly separate and indeed isolated from mainstream society. This jeopardizes their mental health and prevents autistic people from developing to full potential. The situation is not only problematical for the development of autistic people but is also to the detriment of wider society, in so far as autistic people are effectively prevented from contributing fully. This account assumes that some (not necessarily all) autistic people yearn to be included, to be productive and to be useful.

	abstract = {Although autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by impaired social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests, ASD is also characterized by impaired motivational processes. The “social motivation theory of autism” describes how social motivation disruptions in ASD in early childhood may impede the drive to engage in reciprocal social behaviors and ultimately interfere with the development of neural networks critical for social communication (Chevallier et al., Trends Cogn Sci 16:231–239, 2012b). Importantly, clinical studies and preclinical research using model organisms for ASD indicate that motivational impairments in ASD are not constrained to social rewards but are evident in response to a range of nonsocial rewards as well. Additionally, translational studies on certain genetically defined neurodevelopmental disorders associated with ASD indicate that these syndromic forms of ASD are also characterized by motivational deficits and mesolimbic dopamine impairments. In this chapter we summarize clinical and preclinical research relevant to reward processing impairments in ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders. We also propose a nosology to describe reward processing impairments in these disorders that uses a three-axes model. In this triaxial nosology, the first axis defines the direction of the reward response (i.e., anhedonic, hyperhedonic); the second axis defines the construct of the reward process (e.g., reward liking, reward wanting); and the third axis defines the context of the reward response (e.g., social, nonsocial). A more precise nosology for describing reward processing impairments in ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders will aid in the translation of preclinical research to clinical investigations which will ultimately help to speed up the development of interventions that target motivational systems for ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders.},

We retrospectively analyzed diagnostic codes associated with de‐identified electronic health records using a machine learning algorithm to characterize diagnostic patterns in decedents with ASD and matched decedent community controls. Participants were 91 decedents with ASD and 6,186 sex and birth year matched decedent community controls who had died since 1979, the majority of whom were middle aged or older adults at the time of their death. We analyzed all ICD‐9 codes, V‐codes, and E‐codes available in the electronic health record and Elixhauser comorbidity categories associated with those codes. Diagnostic patterns distinguished decedents with ASD from decedent community controls with 75\% sensitivity and 94\% specificity solely based on their lifetime ICD‐9 codes, V‐codes, and E‐codes. Decedents with ASD had higher rates of most conditions, including cardiovascular disease, motor problems, ear problems, urinary problems, digestive problems, side effects from long‐term medication use, and nonspecific lab tests and encounters. In contrast, decedents with ASD had lower rates of cancer. Findings suggest distinctive lifetime diagnostic patterns among decedents with ASD and highlight the need for more research on health outcomes across the lifespan as the population of individuals with ASD ages. As a large wave of individuals with ASD diagnosed in the 1990s enters adulthood and middle age, knowledge about lifetime health problems will become increasingly important for care and prevention efforts.

	abstract = {Background: Children and adolescents with intellectual disability are at risk of developing psychiatric symptoms and disorders; yet, the estimates reported in the literature have been inconsistent, presenting a potential barrier for service planning and delivery. Sources of variability could arise from differences in measurement instruments as well as subgroup membership by severity of intellectual disability, gender and age. This systematic review aimed to address these gaps.
Method: MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to 2018 and selected studies were reviewed. Studies were included if they reported point prevalence estimates of mental health symptomology or diagnoses in a general population of 6- to 21-year-old individuals with intellectual disability. The Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Checklist was applied to eligible papers to appraise their scientific strength. Pooled prevalence for mental health symptomology was determined using a random-effects meta-analysis.
Results: A total of 19 studies were included, including 6151 children and adolescents. The pooled prevalence estimate captured by the Developmental Behaviour Checklist was 38\% (95\% confidence interval = [31, 46]), contrasting with 49\% (95\% confidence interval = [46, 51]) captured by the Child Behaviour Checklist; both rates were higher than a non-intellectual disability population. Severity of intellectual disability did not significantly influence the Developmental Behaviour Checklist risks. Insufficient data were available to conduct statistical analyses on the effects of age, gender and socioeconomic status. Of diagnosed psychiatric disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (30\%), conduct disorder (3–21\%) and anxiety disorders (7–34\%) were the most prevalent conditions.
Conclusion: This review consists of the largest sample hitherto evaluated. In the intellectual disability population, mental health comorbidities could be better detected by a symptom phenotype than a psychiatric diagnostic phenotype. Crucially, future research needs to address the effect of measurement validity in the intellectual disability population. Estimated prevalence rates were high compared to the general population, indicating the importance of systematic screening, case detection and appropriate management.},

	abstract = {Regulatory interactions with the amygdala are thought to be critical for emotional processing in the extended limbic system. Structural equation modeling (path analysis) is a widely used method to quantify interactions among brain regions based on connectivity models, but is often limited by lack of precise anatomical and functional constraints. To address this issue, we developed an automated elaborative path analysis procedure guided by known anatomical connectivity in the macaque. We applied this technique to a large human fMRI data set acquired during perceptual processing of angry or fearful facial stimuli. The derived models were inferentially validated using a bootstrapping split-half approach in pairs of 500 independent groups. Significant paths across the groups were used to form a rigorously validated and consistent path model. We confirm and extend previous observations of amygdala regulation by an extended prefrontal network encompassing cingulate, orbitofrontal, insular, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as strong interactions between amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus. This validated model can be used to study neurocognitive correlates as well as genotype or disease-related alterations of functional interactions in the limbic system.},

	abstract = {Since the 1970s, psychoanalytic conceptualizations of alexithymia have defined the trait as having four core facets: difficulties identifying feelings (DIF), difficulties describing feelings (DDF), externally orientated thinking (EOT), and constricted imaginal processes. However, there is ongoing controversy about whether constricted imaginal processes are actually a core facet of alexithymia, and which (if any) specific aspects of daydreaming/fantasizing activity might be impaired. In this study, we address this foundational issue by using factor analysis to establish the latent structure of the alexithymia construct. Participants (N = 554) completed a comprehensive battery of psychometric measures of alexithymia and imaginal processes, assessing the frequency, vividness, and content of daydreams or fantasies. None of the aspects of fantasizing loaded on the same factor (i.e., the latent alexithymia factor) as the established DIF, DDF, and EOT facets of alexithymia. Furthermore, patterns of Pearson correlations were inconsistent with psychoanalytic theory, as alexithymia was associated with more (not less) frequent daydreams, more daydreams characterized by negative emotions and wish-fulfillment fantasies, and more use of daydreaming to regulate emotions. Our findings are instead consistent with the attention-appraisal model of alexithymia, which holds that alexithymia is best understood as involving deficits in emotion processing.},

	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) refers to neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by symptoms such as social deficits and restricted interests and behavior. Several studies have investigated specific sensory processing in relation to ASD traits. However, findings appear to be inconsistent and inconclusive because of variation in ASD traits among participants and differences in the tasks adopted. In this study, we investigated relationships between sensory thresholds in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities and various ASD traits to account for individual variability of traits in typically developing adults using the same experimental tasks. We estimated detection and discrimination thresholds for brightness, sound pressure, and vibrotactile stimulus strength. We also estimated the degree of ASD traits in each participant with a questionnaire. We found that higher tactile detection and visual discrimination thresholds were related to ASD traits in difficulty of communication. A lower tactile discrimination threshold and higher visual detection threshold was also related to the ASD trait of strong focus of attention. These findings suggest the existence of unique relationships between particular low-level sensory processing and specific ASD traits, indicating that irregularities in sensory processing may underlie variation in ASD traits.},

	abstract = {Lab-based tasks suggest autistic people have increased perceptual capacity (i.e. process more information at any one time) compared to non-autistic people. Here, we explored whether this increase is reflected in autistic people's day-to-day perceptual experiences and, when compared to those with ADHD/neurotypical people, whether commonalities/divergences in these experiences can illuminate differences between neurotypes. UK-based adults (108 autistic, 40 with ADHD, 79 autistic with ADHD, 85 neurotypical) completed an online survey about experiences of attention and distraction. Responses were analysed using thematic analysis. We found that participants of all neurotypes experienced periods of intense focus. Neurodivergent participants reported experiencing a barrage of information; autistic participants found this overwhelming, whereas those with ADHD referred to overload. This finding may reflect increased perceptual capacity for autistic people (adding ecological validity to previous findings regarding increased autistic perceptual capacity) vs. difficulties maintaining attentional priorities for those with ADHD. While differences between neurodivergent and neurotypical people were evident, discrepancies between experiences of neurodivergent groups were more subtle, suggesting that increased perceptual capacity may extend beyond autism. Consequently, perceptual capacity offers a useful framework to promote better understanding of one's own perceptual experiences, and to guide strategies to ameliorate any challenges encountered.},

Children with autism had significantly higher DMDD scores than all other groups, even when the oppositional behavior score (excluding the two DMDD symptoms) was controlled.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, a number of studies have begun to explore the nature of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In this study, we examined the relationship between both symptoms of ADHD and symptoms of ASD on cognitive task performance in a sample of higher-functioning children and adolescents with ASD. Participants completed cognitive tasks tapping aspects of attention, impulsivity/inhibition, and immediate memory.
AIMS: We hypothesized that children with ASD who had higher levels of ADHD symptom severity would be at higher risk for poorer sustained attention and selective attention, greater impulsivity/disinhibition, and weaker memory.
METHODS AND PROCEDURES: The sample included 92 children (73 males) diagnosed with ASD (Mean Age = 9.41 years; Mean Full Scale IQ = 84.2).
OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: Using regression analyses, more severe ADHD symptomatology was found to be significantly related to weaker performance on tasks measuring attention, immediate memory, and response inhibition. In contrast, increasing severity of ASD symptomatology was not associated with higher risk of poorer performance on any of the cognitive tasks assessed.
CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These results suggest that children with ASD who have more severe ADHD symptoms are at higher risk for impairments in tasks assessing attention, immediate memory, and response inhibition-similar to ADHD-related impairments seen in the general pediatric population. As such, clinicians should assess various aspects of cognition in pediatric patients with ASD in order to facilitate optimal interventional and educational planning.},

	abstract = {Current tools for identifying autism are critiqued for their lack of specificity and sensitivity, especially in autistic people who are older, have higher verbal ability or significant compensatory skills, and are not cisgender boys. This may reflect the following: the historical focus of autism research on White (cisgender) male, upper and middle class children; limited interest in the inner, lived experience of autism; and the predominance of a deficit-based model of autism. We report here on the first attempt of which we are aware to develop a clinical self-report measure of autistic traits as described by autistic people. We believe this is an advance in methodology because prior work in the development of autistic trait/diagnostic measures has prioritized the perspectives of nonautistic clinicians and scientists. The measure was developed under the leadership of two autistic researchers and constructed by leveraging descriptions of autism by autistic people to generate items designed to encompass the range of the autistic experience, using strength-based, accessible language. The team utilized iterative feedback from a panel of autistic experts to refine and enhance the measure, called the Self Assessment of Autistic Traits (SAAT). It is intended for people 16 years or older and uses a format that is designed to increase its accessibility and acceptability for autistic respondents. Future work will report on the preliminary psychometrics of the SAAT, with a long-term goal of advancing our understanding of the inner autistic experience and enhancing the clinical and scientific assessment of autism.},

The analytic sample consisted of 10,838 adolescent respondents at age 14 (361 with intellectual disability and 10,477 without) and 9,408 adolescent respondents at age 17 (292 with intellectual disability and 9,116 without).ResultsParental reports of adolescent problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) indicated that adolescents with intellectual disability at ages 14 and 17 were more likely to have problems than those without intellectual disability across all SDQ domains. Adolescent self-report data at age 17 indicated that adolescents with intellectual disability were more likely to (self)-report that they had problems than those without intellectual disability on all but one SDQ domain. The magnitude of relative inequality between those with and without intellectual disability was consistently lower for self-report than parental report. On indicators of depression, mental well-being, self-harm, positive mental health, happiness and general psychological distress at ages 14 and 17, we found no self-reported group differences between adolescents with and without intellectual disability.ConclusionsFurther research is needed to understand: (1) why the magnitude of mental health inequalities between those with and without intellectual disability on the SDQ may be dependent on the identity of the informant; and (2) whether such differences are also apparent for other measures of mental health or well-being.},

In this Review, we discuss the prevalence of mental health problems, interventions to address these, and issues of access to treatment and services. Where possible, we take a global perspective, given most children with intellectual disability live in low-income and middle-income countries. Approximately 40\% of children with intellectual disability present with a diagnosable mental disorder, a rate that is at least double that in children without intellectual disability. Most risk factors for poor mental health and barriers to accessing support are not unique to people with intellectual disability. With proportionate universalism as the guiding principle for reducing poor mental health at scale, we discuss four directions for addressing the mental health inequity in intellectual disability.},

However, information on the association between area deprivation, ethnicity and other forms of intellectual and developmental disabilities are inconclusive.
Aim To estimate the independent association between household disadvantage, local area deprivation, ethnicity and the identification of intellectual and developmental disability.
Methods Cross-sectional survey involving multilevel multivariate analyses of data extracted from educational records on household disadvantage, local area deprivation, ethnicity and identified intellectual and developmental disability in a sample of English children aged 7–15 years (n=5.18 million).
Results Lower household socio-economic position was associated with increased rates of identification of intellectual and developmental disabilities especially less severe forms of intellectual disability. Higher area deprivation was independently associated with increased rates of identification of less severe forms of intellectual disability but decreased rates of identification of profound multiple intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Minority ethnic status was, in general, associated with lower rates of identification of intellectual and developmental disabilities. Exceptions to this general pattern included higher rates of identification of less severe forms of intellectual disability among Gypsy/Romany and Traveller children of Irish heritage, and higher rates of identification of more severe forms of intellectual disability among children of Pakistani and Bangladeshi heritage.
Conclusions Children whose development is already compromised (and especially children with less severe intellectual disabilities) are at increased risk of exposure to social conditions that are themselves inimical to healthy development.},

Little is known about predictors of the persistence of conduct difficulties in the pre-adolescent period in this high-risk group. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from the first three waves of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Results: The prevalence of conduct difficulties at age 4/5 years among children with cognitive delay was independently associated with: living in an income poor household; living in a more deprived neighbourhood; having co-morbid emotional difficulties; having poorer pro-social behaviours; poorer maternal health; greater exposure to angry/harsh parenting; and greater exposure to more inconsistent parenting. The persistence of conduct difficulties at ages 6/7 years and 8/9 years was independently associated with: male child gender; living in material hardship; child expressive communication difficulties; living in a single parent headed household; and greater exposure to angry/harsh and inconsistent parenting. When compared to their more intellectually able peers, children with borderline or intellectual disability were significantly more likely to exhibit persistent conduct difficulties, but only when exposed to multiple environmental risks. These results were consistent across different thresholds for measuring conduct difficulties and different thresholds for measuring cognitive delay. Conclusions: The persistence and high levels of conduct difficulties among this high risk group appears to be associated with a combination of increased risk of exposure to environmental adversity and decreased resilience when so exposed.},

	abstract = {Health inequalities are a perennial concern for policymakers and in service delivery to ensure fair and equitable access and outcomes. As health inequalities are socially influenced by employment, income, and education, this impacts healthcare services among socio-economically disadvantaged groups, making it a pertinent area for investigation in seeking to promote equitable access. Researchers widely acknowledge that health equity is a multi-faceted problem requiring approaches to understand the complexity and interconnections in hospital planning as a precursor to healthcare delivery. Operations research offers the potential to develop analytical models and frameworks to aid in complex decision-making that has both a strategic and operational function in problem-solving. This paper develops a simulation-based modelling framework (SimulEQUITY) to model the complexities in addressing health inequalities at a hospital level. The model encompasses an entire hospital operation (including inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department services) using the discrete-event simulation method to simulate the behaviour and performance of real-world systems, processes, or organisations. The paper makes a sustained contribution to knowledge by challenging the existing population-level planning approaches in healthcare that often overlook individual patient needs, especially within disadvantaged groups. By holistically modelling an entire hospital, socio-economic variations in patients' pathways are developed by incorporating individual patient attributes and variables. This innovative framework facilitates the exploration of diverse scenarios, from processes to resources and environmental factors, enabling key decision-makers to evaluate what intervention strategies to adopt as well as the likely scenarios for future patterns of healthcare inequality. The paper outlines the decision-support toolkit developed and the practical application of the SimulEQUITY model through to implementation within a hospital in the UK. This moves hospital management and strategic planning to a more dynamic position where a software-based approach, incorporating complexity, is implicit in the modelling rather than simplification and generalisation arising from the use of population-based models.},

	abstract = {Background Conditions that should be sufficiently managed in primary health care are collectively known as Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC). The rate of unplanned hospital admissions for ACSC can be regarded as a proxy indicator of how well the primary care system works for a population of interest. We investigate such rates in Scotland, focusing on adults with Intellectual Disabilities (ID) and contrasting them with adults without ID.
Method A population-based retrospective cohort data linkage study of adult respondents to Scotland’s 2011 Census. Self- or proxy-reported ID status from the Census was linked to hospital admissions data and deaths data. The cohort was followed until the end of 2019.
Results After adjusting for different ACSC prevalence in ID and non-ID cohorts, we did not find evidence of there being a higher risk of unplanned ACSC hospitalisation among people with ID. COPD, seizures and epilepsy, influenza and pneumonia were responsible for half of ACSC hospitalisations, regardless of ID status. However, adults with ID had a higher risk of dying due to ACSC than adults without ID.
Conclusions We conclude that overall, the primary care system in Scotland appears to be similarly effective for adults with ID than for adults without ID. However, the higher risk of dying from ACSC among people with ID needs further research.},

The prevalence was higher in mild, moderate and severe intellectual disability than in profound intellectual disability. Conclusions Psychiatric disorders are common in subjects with intellectual disability, and the present authors found that clinical and methodological moderators affect the pooled prevalence.},

	abstract = {Background People with intellectual disability (ID) are a group with high levels of healthcare needs; however, comprehensive information on these needs and service use is very limited.
Aim To describe chronic disease, comorbidity, disability, and general practice use among people with ID compared with the general population.
Design and setting This study is a cross-sectional analysis of a primary care database including 408 English general practices in 2012.
Method A total of 14 751 adults with ID, aged 18–84 years, were compared with 86 221 age-, sex- and practice-matched controls. Depending on the outcome, prevalence (PR), risk (RR), or odds (OR) ratios comparing patients with ID with matched controls are shown.
Results Patients with ID had a markedly higher prevalence of recorded epilepsy (18.5\%, PR 25.33, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 23.29 to 27.57), severe mental illness (8.6\%, PR 9.10, 95\% CI = 8.34 to 9.92), and dementia (1.1\%, PR 7.52, 95\% CI = 5.95 to 9.49), as well as moderately increased rates of hypothyroidism and heart failure (PR{\textgreater}2.0). However, recorded prevalence of ischaemic heart disease and cancer was approximately 30\% lower than the general population. The average annual number of primary care consultations was 6.29 for patients with ID, compared with 3.89 for matched controls. Patients with ID were less likely to have longer doctor consultations (OR 0.73, 95\% CI = 0.69 to 0.77), and had lower continuity of care with the same doctor (OR 0.77, 95\% CI = 0.73 to 0.82).
Conclusion Compared with the general population, people with ID have generally higher overall levels of chronic disease and greater primary care use. Ensuring access to high-quality chronic disease management, especially for epilepsy and mental illness, will help address these greater healthcare needs. Continuity of care and longer appointment times are important potential improvements in primary care.},

	abstract = {Introduction Providing safe, high-quality admitted-patient care for people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) requires consideration for their special needs particularly in relation to communication and consent. To make allowance for these special requirements, it would be helpful for hospitals to know how often they are likely to arise. This study set out to identify the amount and patterns of use of acute, non-psychiatric hospital admitted-patient care in England by people with ID. Patterns are considered in relation to clinical specialties, modes of admission (emergency or planned) and life stages (children and young people, working age and older adults). In each case, patterns for people with ID are compared with patterns for those without. Methods Descriptive observational study using a major general practitioner (GP) research database (Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD) linked to routine national statistical records of admitted-patient care. Results Overall people identified by their GP as having ID had higher rates of admitted-patient care episodes and longer durations of stay than those without. Differences varied considerably between clinical specialties with rates more elevated in medical and paediatric than surgical specialties. Admitted-patient care rates for women with ID in obstetrics and gynaecology were lower than for other women, while rates for admitted-patient dental care were much higher for both men and women with ID. In an average English health administrative area with a local population of 250 000 people, at any time, there are likely to be approximately 670 people receiving acute admitted-patient care. Approximately six of these are likely to have been identified by their GP as having ID. At 0.9\% of hospital in-patients, this is just under twice the proportion in the population. Conclusion and implications Our figures are likely to be an underestimate as GP identification of people with ID is known to be far from complete. However, they indicate that the number of people with ID in acute hospital settings is likely to be substantially more than a recent survey of English health services indicated they were aware of. The study is intended to help guide expectations for acute hospitals seeking to audit the completeness of their identification of people with ID and to indicate their likely distribution between clinical specialties.},

	abstract = {Background Intellectual disability (ID) carries a high impact on need for care, health status and premature mortality. Respiratory system diseases contribute a major part of mortality among people with ID, but remain underinvestigated as consequent morbidities.
Methods Anonymised electronic mental health records from the South London and Maudsley Trust (SLaM) were linked to national acute medical care data. Using retrospective cohort and matched case–control study designs, adults with ID receiving SLaM care between 1 January 2008 and 31 March 2013 were identified and compared with local catchment residents for respiratory system disease admissions. Standardised admission ratios (SARs) were first calculated, followed by a comparison of duration of hospitalisation with respiratory system disease between people with ID and age-matched and gender-matched random counterparts modelled using linear regression. Finally, the risk of readmission for respiratory system disease was analysed using the Cox models.
Results For the 3138 adults with ID identified in SLaM, the SAR for respiratory system disease admissions was 4.02 (95\% CI 3.79 to 4.26). Compared with adults without ID, duration of hospitalisation was significantly longer by 2.34 days (95\% CI 0.03 to 4.64) and respiratory system disease readmission was significantly elevated (HR=1.35; 95\% CI 1.17 to 1.56) after confounding adjustment.
Conclusions Respiratory system disease admissions in adults with ID are more frequent, of longer duration and have a higher likelihood of recurring. Development and evaluation of potential interventions to the preventable causes of respiratory diseases should be prioritised.},

Trends (1995-2010) in visits with mental health care indicators are first compared between youths (\&lt;21 years) and adults (≥21 years) and then between children (0-13 years) and adolescents (14-20 years). Background and clinical characteristics of recent visits (2007-2010) resulting in a mental disorder diagnosis are also compared among children, adolescents, and adults.Visits resulting in mental disorder diagnoses, prescription of psychotropic medications, provision of psychotherapy, or psychiatrist care.Between 1995-1998 and 2007-2010, visits resulting in mental disorder diagnoses per 100 population increased significantly faster for youths (from 7.78 to 15.30 visits) than for adults (from 23.23 to 28.48 visits) (interaction: P \&lt; .001). Psychiatrist visits also increased significantly faster for youths (from 2.86 to 5.71 visits) than for adults (from 10.22 to 10.87 visits) (interaction: P \&lt; .001). Psychotropic medication visits increased at comparable rates for youths (from 8.35 to 17.12 visits) and adults (from 30.76 to 65.90 visits) (interaction: P = .13). While psychotherapy visits increased from 2.25 to 3.17 per 100 population for youths, they decreased from 8.37 to 6.36 for adults (interaction: P \&lt; .001). In 2007-2010, 27.4\% of child visits, 47.9\% of adolescent visits, and 36.6\% of adult visits resulting in a mental disorder diagnosis were to a psychiatrist.Compared with adult mental health care, the mental health care of young people has increased more rapidly and has coincided with increased psychotropic medication use. A great majority of mental health care in office-based medical practice to children, adolescents, and adults is provided by nonpsychiatrist physicians calling for increased consultation and communication between specialties.},

	abstract = {Background Globally, people with intellectual disabilities and/or autism experience health inequalities. Death occurs at a younger age and the prevalence of long-term morbidities is higher than in the general population. Despite this, their primary healthcare access rates are lower than the general population, their health needs are often unmet, and their views and experiences are frequently overlooked in research, policy, and practice.
Aim To investigate the barriers and facilitators reported by individuals with intellectual disabilities, autism, or both, and/or their carers, to accessing and utilising primary health care for their physical and mental health needs.
Design \& setting An integrative review was undertaken, which used systematic review methodology.
Method Electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Cochrane were searched for relevant studies (all languages) using a search strategy. Two researchers independently screened the results and assessed the quality of the studies.
Results Sixty-three international studies were identified. Six main themes relating to barriers and facilitators emerged from an analysis of these studies. The main themes were: training; knowledge and awareness; communication; fear and embarrassment; involvement in healthcare decision-making; and time. All the themes were underpinned by the need for greater care, dignity, respect, collaborative relationships, and reasonable adjustments. Opposing barriers and facilitators were identified within each of the main themes.
Conclusion Adolescents and adults with intellectual disabilities and/or autism experience several barriers to accessing and utilising primary health care. The findings highlight the reasonable adjustments and facilitators that can be implemented to ensure that these individuals are not excluded from primary health care.},

	abstract = {Background Previous research has shown poor hospital experiences and dire outcomes for people with intellectual disability. The main objective of this study was to prospectively track episodes for adults with intellectual disability (ID) in Australian hospitals, with a focus on indications of the quality of care provided. Methods A prospective audit of hospital records over 35 months yielded quantitative data about patient characteristics, frequency and length of hospital episodes, diagnostic assessments and outcomes, post-emergency department (ED) destinations and post-discharge recommendations. Fifty participants were recruited largely by identification on hospital ED entry. An audit of patients' hospital records was conducted towards the end of hospital episodes, using a tool developed for the study. Results Participants were mostly men (70\%), aged 42.9 years on average, living mostly with family (46\%) or in supported accommodation (44\%). Of 157 recorded episodes, 96\% started in ED, 85\% required urgent or semi-urgent care and 62\% were in the first 3 months of study participation. Average time in ED exceeded the 4-h national benchmark, met in 40\% of episodes. One or more diagnostic assessments were conducted in 91\% episodes and others in short stay units. Almost half (49\%) resulted in a ward stay. With an extreme data point removed, {\textless}1–35 days were spent in wards. The most frequent diagnosis in 75\% of episodes was for digestive problems, followed by nervous system problems then injuries. Median length of bed stays reflected data available for Australian refined diagnosis-related groups. High hospital re-presentations were found: for 67\% of episodes in total, 26\% (n = 12) of which were within 72 h and 59\% (n = 23) within 30 days. Conclusions Adults with ID presented frequently to ED and often had lengthy stays. We found no indication of poor care practices in terms of hospital staff willingness to keep patients in ED and conduct of diagnostic assessments. Frequent re-presentations, however, indicated failed hospital care at some level.},

Method A cross-sectional study of 1367 admissions for 1018 randomly selected patients admitted for more than 23 hours to one of two tertiary children’s hospitals in Sydney, Australia (1st January–31st December 2017). Electronic medical records were manually interrogated to identify children with intellectual disability (including developmental delay). Data extracted included patient demographics, length of stay, number of admissions, and reported clinical incidents. Results In total, 12.3\% (n=125) of children admitted during the study period had intellectual disability, which represented 13.9\% (n=190) of admissions. Sex and age at admission in children with and without intellectual disability were similar: 83 (43.7\%) vs 507 (43.1\%) females and 107 (56.3\%) vs 670 (56.9\%) males, p=0.875; median age 3 years (0–18y) vs 4 years (0–18y), p=0.122. Children with intellectual disability had significantly greater median length of stay (100.5h vs 79h, p{\textless}0.001) and cost of admission (A{\textbackslash}11 596.38 vs A{\textbackslash}8497.96) than their peers (p=0.001). Children with intellectual disability had more admissions with at least one incident compared to children without intellectual disability (14.7\% vs 9.7\%); this was not statistically significant (p=0.06). Interpretation Children with intellectual disability experience inequitable quality and safety outcomes in hospital.

	abstract = {This BTS Clinical Statement addresses the risk assessment, prevention and management of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in people with a learning disability of all ages. Each section is summarised with key clinical practice points. The recommendations made are based on a comprehensive review of the published evidence, where available and pertinent, but are predominantly based on expert opinion aimed at providing useful pragmatic guidance.

Learning disability is the preferred term used in the UK to refer to individuals who have ‘significantly reduced ability to understand new or complex information, to learn new skills’ and a ‘reduced ability to cope independently which starts before adulthood with lasting effects on development’.1 Individuals with learning disability represent a widely heterogeneous group of people and can be associated with a broad range of primary diagnoses and comorbidities.2

There is no definitive record of the number of people with learning disability in England. However, Public Health England (PHE) estimates that in 2015 the population was 1 087 100, including 930 400 adults (approximating 2\% of the adult population). The estimated prevalence of learning disability in children and young people (CYP) is 2.5\%.3 Far fewer individuals with learning disability were recorded in health and welfare systems. For example, only 324 291 children and adults were identified as having learning disability on general practitioner (GP) practice-based registers in 2021.4 It is likely that those registered have a more severe learning disability or more commonly associated conditions, for example, Down syndrome. This is important, as it means that many individuals with learning disability do not have their diagnosis recognised within health and welfare systems potentially increasing their vulnerability through lack of access to regular health reviews and other relevant public health programmes, for example, vaccination programmes. A series of measures have been introduced by the National Health …},

	abstract = {Objectives To investigate mortality in adults with intellectual disabilities: rates, causes, place, demographic and clinical predictors.
Design Cohort study with record linkage to death data.
Setting General community.
Participants 961/1023 (94\%) adults (16–83 years; mean=44.1 years; 54.6\% male) with intellectual disabilities, clinically examined in 2001–2004; subsequently record-linked to their National Health Service number, allowing linkage to death certificate data, 2018.
Outcome measures Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs), underlying and all contributing causes of death, avoidable deaths, place, and demographic and clinical predictors of death.
Results 294/961 (30.6\%) had died; 64/179 (35.8\%) with Down syndrome, 230/783 (29.4\%) without Down syndrome. SMR overall=2.24 (1.98, 2.49); Down syndrome adults=5.28 (3.98, 6.57), adults without Down syndrome=1.93 (1.68, 2.18); male=1.69 (1.42, 1.95), female=3.48 (2.90, 4.06). SMRs decreased as age increased. More severe intellectual disabilities increased SMR, but ability was not retained in the multivariable model. SMRs were higher for most International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision chapters. For adults without Down syndrome, aspiration/reflux/choking and respiratory infection were the the most common underlying causes of mortality; for Down syndrome adults ‘Down syndrome’, and dementia were most common. Amenable deaths (29.8\%) were double that in the general population (14\%); 60.3\% died in hospital. Mortality risk related to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/tube fed, Down syndrome, diabetes, lower respiratory tract infection at cohort-entry, smoking, epilepsy, hearing impairment, increasing number of prescribed drugs, increasing age. Bowel incontinence reduced mortality risk.
Conclusions Adults with intellectual disabilities with and without Down syndrome have different SMRs and causes of death which should be separately reported. Both die younger, from different causes than other people. Some mortality risks are similar to other people, with earlier mortality reflecting more multimorbidity; amenable deaths are also common. This should inform actions to reduce early mortality, for example, training to avoid aspiration/choking, pain identification to address problems before they are advanced, and reasonable adjustments to improve healthcare quality.},

Design Matched cohort study; an ID cohort of 506 patients were matched based on age, sex and ethnicity with a control group using a 1:3 ratio to compare outcomes from the International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Infections Consortium WHO Clinical Characterisation Protocol UK.
Setting Admissions for COVID-19 from UK hospitals; data on symptoms, severity, access to interventions, complications, mortality and length of stay were extracted.
Interventions Non-invasive respiratory support, intubation, tracheostomy, ventilation and admission to intensive care units (ICU).
Results Subjective presenting symptoms such as loss of taste/smell were less frequently reported in ID patients, whereas indicators of more severe disease such as altered consciousness and seizures were more common. Controls had higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors, asthma, rheumatological disorder and smoking. ID patients were admitted with higher respiratory rates (median=22, range=10–48) and were more likely to require oxygen therapy (35.1\% vs 28.9\%). Despite this, ID patients were 37\% (95\% CI 13\% to 57\%) less likely to receive non-invasive respiratory support, 40\% (95\% CI 7\% to 63\%) less likely to receive intubation and 50\% (95\% CI 30\% to 66\%) less likely to be admitted to the ICU while in hospital. They had a 56\% (95\% CI 17\% to 102\%) increased risk of dying from COVID-19 after they were hospitalised and were dying 1.44 times faster (95\% CI 1.13 to 1.84) compared with controls.
Conclusions There have been significant disparities in healthcare between people with ID and the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have contributed to excess mortality in this group.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Ambulatory or primary care sensitive conditions (ACSCs) are those conditions for which hospital admission could be prevented by interventions in primary care. At present, different definitions of ACSCs are used for research and health policy analysis. This study aimed to explore the impact of different definitions of ACSCs and associated disease codes on analysis of health service activity.
Study design
Retrospective cross-sectional study using Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).
Methods
All ACSCs identified by a literature search were documented. Conditions and codes were standardized using International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10. A subset of ACSCs commonly used in England was compared with all 36 ACSCs identified by the search in a retrospective cross-sectional study using HES.
Results
In total, 36 potential ACSCs were identified, which contained numerous subcategories. The most frequently used subset of ACSCs in the NHS only contains 19 ACSCs. There were 4,659,054 emergency admissions in England in 2005/6, of which 1,900,409 were ACSCs using the full set of 36 conditions. The proportion of these admissions attributable to the NHS subset of 19 ASCS was 35\%. The underlying ICD10 codes used to define ACSCs vary widely across subsets of ACSCs used in the NHS. This impacts on rates of admission, length of stay and costs attributable to ACSCs.
Conclusions
Rates of hospital admission for ACSCs are increasingly used as a measure of the effectiveness of primary care. However, different conceptual interpretations of the term ‘ACSC’ and use of differing definitions and diagnostic codes impact on the proportion of admissions that are attributed as ACSCs. Some resolution of these inconsistencies is required for this measure to be more useful to decision makers.},

Methods Structured searches of PubMed were conducted to identify up-to-date information on the incidence of CAP in adults in Europe, as well as data on lifestyle and medical risk factors for CAP.
Results The overall annual incidence of CAP in adults ranged between 1.07 to 1.2 per 1000 person-years and 1.54 to 1.7 per 1000 population and increased with age (14 per 1000 person-years in adults aged ≥65 years). Incidence was also higher in men than in women and in patients with chronic respiratory disease or HIV infection. Lifestyle factors associated with an increased risk of CAP included smoking, alcohol abuse, being underweight, having regular contact with children and poor dental hygiene. The presence of comorbid conditions, including chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, dementia, dysphagia, HIV or chronic renal or liver disease all increased the risk of CAP by twofold to fourfold.
Conclusion A range of lifestyle factors and underlying medical conditions are associated with an increased risk of CAP in European adults. Understanding of the types of individual at greatest risk of CAP can help to ensure that interventions to reduce the risk of infection and burden of disease are targeted appropriately.},

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Embase, CINAHL, ISI Web of Science (all databases including Medline) and PsychINFO were searched for studies published between 1st January 1985 and 27th April 2020 and examined study and outcome quality. Reference lists and Google Scholar were also hand searched.
Results We identified 2295 studies, 17 were included in the narrative synthesis and 10 studies (11 cohorts) in the meta-analysis. Data from 90 302 people with intellectual disabilities and 13 808 deaths from all causes in people with intellectual disabilities were extracted. Significantly higher rates of respiratory-associated deaths were found among people with intellectual disabilities (standardised mortality ratio(SMR): 10.86 (95\% CI: 5.32 to 22.18, p{\textless}0.001) compared with those in the general population, lesser rates for adults with ID (SMR: 6.53 (95\% CI: 4.29 to 9.96, p{\textless}0.001); and relatively high rates from pneumonia 26.65 (95\% CI: 5.63 to 126.24, p{\textless}0.001). The overall statistical heterogeneity was I2=99.0\%.
Conclusion Premature deaths due to respiratory disorders are potentially avoidable with improved public health initiatives and equitable access to quality healthcare. Further research should focus on developing prognostic guidance and validated tools for clinical practice to mitigate risks of respiratory-associated deaths.

This article presents recent conceptualizations that begin to disentangle health from disability, summarizes the literature from 1999 to 2005 in terms of the cascade of disparities, reviews intervention issues and promising practices, and provides recommendations for future action and research. The reconceptualization of health and disability examines health disparity in terms of the determinants of health (genetic, social circumstances, environment, individual behaviors, health care access) and types of health conditions (associated, comorbid, secondary). The literature is summarized in terms of a cascade of disparities experienced by people with ID, including a higher prevalence of adverse conditions, inadequate attention to care needs, inadequate focus on health promotion, and inadequate access to quality health care services. Promising practices are reviewed from the perspective of persons with ID, providers of care and services, and policies that influence systems of care. Recommendations across multiple countries and organizations are synthesized as guidelines to direct future action. They call for promoting principles of early identification, inclusion, and self-determination of people with ID; reducing the occurrence and impact of associated, comorbid, and secondary conditions; empowering caregivers and family members; promoting healthy behaviors in people with ID; and ensuring equitable access to quality health care by people with ID. Their broadscale implementations would begin to reduce the health disparity experienced by people with ID. MRDD Research Reviews 2006;12:70–82. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To identify, using a consensus development process, a list of common conditions likely to be ambulatory care sensitive (ACS); i.e. conditions for which practicable improvements in access to timely and effective ambulatory care in the English National Health Service would either reduce the incidence of the condition or avoid substantial proportions of current hospital admissions.
Methods: Three panels of clinicians each reviewed about a third of an initial list of 174 conditions commonly recorded as hospital discharge diagnoses for residents of the North West Thames Region. For each condition, panellists estimated the proportion of cases currently admitted to hospital for which, given timely and effective ambulatory care: onset of disease could have been prevented; admission for existing disease could have been prevented; admission, once indicated, should take place within 48 hours. After an introductory meeting to discuss and clarify the task, panel members completed three rounds of a questionnaire, with postal feedback between each round, and a second meeting to discuss interim results before the final round. Seventeen general practitioners (GPs) and 17 hospital specialists working in the region comprised the panels.
Results: The panels considered that for 30 of the 174 conditions at least 70\% of admissions to hospital could be avoided, either by prevention of disease onset or timely and effective ambulatory care, though predominantly through the latter. For each of a further 66 conditions, 50–69\% of admissions could be prevented. Within-panel agreement between hospital specialists and GPs was generally good, although the GPs tended to give slightly higher scores for avoidability of admissions than the specialists. There was marked convergence of scores in succeeding rounds.
Conclusions: Although a consensus-based list of ACS conditions cannot be definitive, the clear view of the panels was that the scope for avoiding admission through better ambulatory care is very substantial.},

	abstract = {Objectives Pneumonia severity tools were primarily developed in cohorts of hospitalized patients, limiting their applicability to the emergency department (ED). We describe current community ED admission practices and examine the accuracy of the CURB-65 to predict 30-day mortality for patients, either discharged or admitted with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Methods A retrospective, observational study of adult CAP encounters in 14 community EDs within an integrated healthcare system. We calculated CURB-65 scores for all encounters and described the use of hospitalization, stratified by each score (0–5). We then used each score as a cutoff to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratios, and negative likelihood ratios for predicting 30-day mortality. Results The sample included 21,183 ED encounters for CAP (7,952 discharged and 13,231 admitted). The C-statistic describing the accuracy of CURB-65 for predicting 30-day mortality in the full sample was 0.761 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.747–0.774). The C-statistic was 0.864 (95\% CI, 0.821–0.906) among patients discharged from the ED compared with 0.689 (95\% CI, 0.672–0.705) among patients who were admitted. Among all ED encounters a CURB-65 threshold of ≥1 was 92.8\% sensitive and 38.0\% specific for predicting mortality, with a 99.9\% NPV. Among all encounters, 62.5\% were admitted, including 36.2\% of those at lowest risk (CURB-65 = 0). Conclusions CURB-65 had very good accuracy for predicting 30-day mortality among patients discharged from the ED. This severity tool may help ED providers risk stratify patients to assist with disposition decisions and identify unwarranted variation in patient care.},

	abstract = {Internet-based online surveys are a crucial tool for researchers to learn about the understudied and often overlooked population of autistic adults. The recruitment and administration of online surveys can be cheaper, quicker, and have a wider reach compared with more traditional in-person methods. As online surveys become more prevalent, it is important to place strengths in the context of limitations and biases that can arise when recruiting and administering surveys online. In this perspective, we discuss two common issues that often appear in studies that use online tools to recruit and administer surveys to autistic adults and nonautistic volunteers: selection bias and sample identifiability. Selection bias is the distortion in effect estimates (e.g., relative risk, risk ratio, incidence rate) resulting from the factors that influence why a person chose to participate or how the researcher recruits and selects participants in a study. Sampling identifiability is the ability (or inability) to quantify and define the population of interest. We use a case example of an online survey study of suicidal ideation in autistic adults and describe how issues in selection bias and sample identifiability arise and may lead to challenges unique to studying autistic adults. We conclude with recommendations to improve the quality and utility of online survey research in autistic adults. Using online resources to recruit and collect data on autistic adults is an incredible tool with great potential; yet, authors need to consider the limitations, potential biases, and tools to overcome systematic error at each stage of the study.},

Although the neuroatypical population has a history of under- and unemployment, their inclusion in the modern workplace (i.e., promotion of neurodiversity within organizations) is gaining recognition by scholars and organizations as an important dimension of organizational diversity. Despite this burgeoning interest in examining neuroatypicality in the context of organizational diversity, surprisingly little research has been conducted that bridges these two research areas. The literature that does exist is scattered across several different academic disciplines, largely outside of industrial-organizational psychology, and rarely examines the employment of neuroatypical workers explicitly from a diversity perspective. In this article we argue that as the nature of work evolves and jobs continue to become more specialized, neurodiversity will become an increasingly relevant dimension of organizational diversity and is likely to play a key role both in terms of individual employees’ well-being and performance outcomes, as well as organizational success.},

Measurement of continuity has proved difficult, however. Commonly applied measures, usual provider of care (UPC), continuity of care (COC), and the modified continuity index (MCI), either ignore key aspects of continuity or provide misleading results. Consequently, a new measure of continuity, the modified, modified continuity index (MMCI), with a possible range of 0 to 1, was developed to overcome these problems. It was applied to a residency model practice, in which mean MMCI was found to be 0.59 (range 0.3 to 1.0). Mean COC was .41 and a mean MCI was .44. Thus, unlike COC and MCI, MMCI suggests fairly good continuity of care in this practice while still implying possible improvement. The MMCI should be useful for enhancing training and practice of family medicine.},

	abstract = {Accessible Summary Many people with learning disabilities are caught up in the criminal justice system. Yet few studies have explored what this is like for them. The available research suggests that people with learning disabilities often feel alone and afraid when they are caught up in the criminal justice system. They do not understand what is happening to them, and they feel like there is no one they can turn to for support. The findings raise concerns about how people with learning disabilities are treated within the criminal justice system, and whether their rights are being respected. Further research is needed to better understand the experiences and support needs of people with learning disabilities who are caught up in the criminal justice system. Summary The aim of this review is to synthesise findings from research about the experiences of people with learning disabilities who have faced arrest and jail time. After an extensive search of the literature, four relevant articles were found. The first-person accounts presented in these four studies were pooled, and a thematic analysis was undertaken. Three common themes were identified: (i) study participants did not understand what was happening to them, or why, (ii) they felt alone, and they did not know where to turn, or to whom for support and (iii) they were uncertain about what to say or do. Overall, the findings raise concerns about the treatment of people with learning disabilities in the criminal justice system and their access to procedural justice. Further research is needed to improve understanding of their experiences and support needs. There is unequivocal evidence that persons with learning disabilities are over-represented in the prison population. To date however, few studies have investigated their first-hand experience, including their experiences of being interrogated, of standing trial, serving time and transitioning back into the community. The purpose of this review is to draw what insights we can from the limited available data and to identify directions for future research.},

However, the delivery of social care in prisons has been (at best) inconsistent and there has been no previous review to inform provision for people on release. Objective: To identify and synthesise what is known about the social care needs of people on release from prison and how best to meet these. Method: A scoping review encompassing systematic searches of 26 electronic databases (January 2010–July 2021) included a wide range of literature. No exclusions were made on the basis of study design, method or quality. Findings were organised according to their contribution to the research questions. Findings: Forty-six documents met the review criteria of which 27 were from the UK. Just two focused specifically on the topic of interest and most of the extracted material was descriptive in nature. Almost no information was found on the number of people released from prison in need of social care. However, the challenges of providing care for this group appeared well understood. Although there were many examples of good practice and widespread consensus about its enablers, outcome information was lacking. Limitations: In keeping with the nature of the review, the quality of the literature was not formally assessed. Implications: The review identified several promising initiatives ranging from prison buddy schemes to pre-release training in everyday living skills and personalised pathway documents. Conclusions: Policy makers and researchers must now shift their attention to the effectiveness of particular interventions in improving social care outcomes.},

When applying these methods, the material is analyzed using concepts from this philosophy to interrogate the findings and to enable greater theoretical analysis. However, the phenomenological approach represents different approaches, from pure description to those more informed by interpretation. Phenomenological philosophy developed from a discipline focusing on thorough descriptions, and only descriptions, toward a greater emphasis on interpretation being inherent in experience. An analogous development toward a broader acknowledgment of the need for interpretation, the influence of the relationship and the researcher, and the co-construction of the narrative is mirrored in qualitative analytic theory and the description of newer analytic methods as, for example, Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and Critical Narrative Analysis, methods which are theoretically founded in phenomenology. This methodological development and the inevitable contribution of interpretation are illustrated by a case from my own research about psychological interventions and the process of understanding in general practice.},

However, the complex interactions between two distinct but clearly related processes, disease progression and care provision, can lead to such models being cumbersome and lacking in transparency. Representing disease progression as a series of queues and activities is not always intuitive to a non-modeller. This paper presents a novel hybrid simulation approach in which health status is modelled using statecharts, thus combining DES with agent-based simulation. This hybrid approach allows disease progression to be modelled in a more natural way, keeping the overall model structure relatively simple. The approach is illustrated by a case study that evaluates the impact of telecare services for supporting people with dementia.},

This study aimed to establish autistic people’s unique experiences of hiring processes in the United Kingdom, by comparing them to the experiences of non-autistic neurodivergent people and neurotypical people. Using qualitative and quantitative data from 225 autistic, 64 non-autistic neurodivergent and 88 neurotypical adults, we identified a series of (dis)similarities in participants’ views and experiences of recruitment for employment. Similarities across the three groups included (1) frustration with the focus on social skills; (2) a perceived need for more flexible hiring processes; (3) a desire for more clarity and (4) the importance of the environment. Participants also acknowledged the important role employers play in one’s decision to disclose a diagnosis or access need. Yet, autistic people faced a set of unique barriers to successful recruitment, over and above those that non-autistic people faced. For example, the perceived pressure to mask autistic traits to succeed and concerns about stigma and discrimination. Participants’ recommendations for improvements included the use of more practical recruitment strategies (e.g. work trials), more clarity about what to expect, and improvements in recruiters’ understanding of the challenges autistic and neurodivergent candidates may face.
Lay abstract
Autistic people are less likely to have a job than non-autistic people. One reason for this may be that hiring processes (e.g. job applications, interviews) can be challenging for autistic people. To better understand the experiences of hiring processes in the United Kingdom, we asked 225 autistic, 64 neurodivergent (but not autistic) and 64 adults with no reported area of neurodivergence questions about their experiences using an online survey. We found a range of similarities and differences in responses. For example, participants in all three groups were frustrated with the focus on social skills in recruitment and said they wanted more practical methods (e.g. work trials) that help them show their skills and abilities. Autistic and otherwise neurodivergent participants discussed the importance of the environment (e.g. the interview/assessment room) in improving experiences. Participants also discussed how employers can impact whether somebody decides to disclose their diagnosis or needs – or not. Autistic people experienced some barriers to successful recruitment that non-autistic people did not. For example, autistic people felt they had to hide their autistic traits to gain employment and many autistic people were worried about being discriminated against if they disclosed that they were autistic during the hiring process. To make experiences better, our participants said that employers should offer candidates different recruitment methods and give them more information about the hiring process. They also said employers should improve their understanding of autism and other hidden disabilities so they know the challenges that people might face during recruitment.},

	abstract = {Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates of both unemployment and depression. Though job loss predicts increased risk of depression in the general population, studies have yet to directly examine this relationship among individuals with ASD. With the backdrop of rising unemployment due to COVID-19, we used a longitudinal design to examine whether employment changes predicted increasing depressive symptoms among young adults with ASD. Online surveys were collected from young adults with ASD at two times: just before widespread social distancing measures were adopted in the United States, and again 10 weeks later. Both time points included measurement of depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory-2). At Time 2, COVID-related employment changes and the perceived impact of those changes on well-being were collected. Of the young adults who were employed at Time 1 (n = 144), over one-third (37.5\%) reported employment changes during the first 2 months of COVID-19. Most of this change was job loss or reductions in hours or pay (“job loss/reduction”). Controlling for Time 1 depressive symptoms, young adults who experienced job loss/reduction had significantly higher depressive symptoms at Time 2 than those without an employment change. Individuals' perceived impact of employment change also predicted depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that losing a job or experiencing reductions in hours or pay leads to worsening depressive symptoms among adults with ASD. Better supporting autistic adults in the workplace may not only decrease the likelihood of job loss, but also combat the exceedingly high rates of depression in this group. Lay Summary Though unemployment has been linked to mental health problems in the general population, this relationship is seldom considered among adults with autism. In this study, we found that adults on the autism spectrum who lost their jobs or experienced reductions in pay or hours during the first 2 months of COVID-19 had worsening depression compared to adults who did not have job changes. Our findings suggest that increasing access to employment may help alleviate poor mental health among autistic adults.},

	abstract = {Background: Autistic individuals face challenges in the workplace, particularly related to social communication. Diagnostic disclosure may mitigate these challenges, but it also exposes individuals to potential discrimination. This study aimed to share the diagnostic disclosure experiences of autistic adults in the workplace to help employers better understand the process, and help other autistic individuals make an informed decision about disclosure.
Methods: The participants in this study were 238 clinically diagnosed, U.K.-based autistic adults with employment experience. Participants completed an online survey, comprising both open-ended and closed-ended questions, that asked about their experiences of disclosure in the workplace. Specifically, questions focused on when in the employment process participants disclosed, to whom the disclosure was made, what factors were involved in the decision to disclose, and what the impacts were of this decision.
Results: Our findings suggest that when deciding to disclose, the participants were most concerned about how this might affect the attitudes of others in the workplace. Participants most often only disclosed selectively, while over a third disclosed to everyone. Many participants chose to disclose when completing the application materials or after starting the job, but rarely in the interview process. Many also disclosed after encountering issues at work (i.e., retrospective disclosure). Just over a third of participants rated the impact of disclosing to supervisors and coworkers positively. Subsequent adjustments made were even less positively endorsed.
Conclusions: Autistic individuals must weigh the potential benefits of disclosure against the costs. This study highlights the need for organizations, rather than autistic individuals, to take more responsibility for facilitating disclosure and improving outcomes to it. Specific recommendations include the creation of clear pathways for disclosure in workplaces, and an ongoing commitment to organization-wide autism training to reduce stigma and discrimination for autistic employees.
Lay summary
Why was this study done?
Autistic individuals face challenges in the workplace. Telling someone that you have an autism diagnosis (disclosure) might be one way of addressing these challenges (e.g., by increasing the understanding of others). However, the literature on disclosure shows mixed outcomes and rarely gives voice to autistic people.
What was the purpose of this study?
The purpose of this study was to explore the disclosure experiences of autistic job seekers and employees and gain insight into their decision-making.
What did the researchers do?
We conducted an online survey with 238 clinically diagnosed autistic adults with employment experience. Our participants answered some questions about their personal information (e.g., age) and their past work experience before completing survey questions about disclosure. We read through everyone's answers to open-ended questions and put the answers into groups, such as “Reasons to disclose” and “Reasons not to disclose.”
What were the results of the study?
When deciding whether or not to disclose, our participants were most concerned about what other people they worked with would think. Most of our participants only told some people at work about their diagnosis, and many only disclosed after issues arose in the workplace. Over a third, however, disclosed to everyone. Participants said they were most likely to disclose on the application materials or after starting a job, not during a job interview. Just over one-third said that telling their supervisors or coworkers they were autistic had a positive impact, and that the changes made by their supervisors afterward were positive. Over a third said the changes made by their coworkers were neither positive nor negative.
What do these findings add to what was already known?
This is the first large-scale U.K.-based study on the disclosure experiences of autistic adults in the workplace. Our findings suggest that autistic people focus most on what other people will think and how others will treat them if they disclose. We found that disclosure during interviews is unlikely—contrary to what previous studies focused on—and that we need to conduct research looking at disclosure in more likely scenarios.
What are potential weaknesses in the study?
Most of our participants were white and female, but in the wider autistic population that isn't the case. We had many more participants who had told people at work about their autism diagnosis than those who had not. We also could not ask any follow-up questions about our participants' experiences because the survey was online.
How will these findings help autistic adults now or in the future?
Knowing more about the experiences of autistic people can help individuals to make an informed choice about disclosing their diagnosis. This study highlights that we need to involve nonautistic employers, colleagues, and organization leaders in the disclosure process to improve autism knowledge and acceptance, and hopefully improve outcomes for autistic people.},

	abstract = {Autistic people face many challenges entering the workforce, for example, during job interviews where performance is reliant on particular social skills. To be competitive during job interviews, autistic people may experience pressure to conceal or ‘camouflage’ their autistic traits and behaviour. This qualitative study used semi-structured interviews to explore the job interview experiences of 10 autistic people. Based on the literature, we were curious as to whether participants would report behaviour consistent with the camouflaging hypothesis. Thematic analysis identified six themes reflecting individual and environmental factors. Participants reported engaging in camouflaging behaviour during job interviews, with external factors (e.g. avoid being treated differently) cited as the primary reason. Participants reported that camouflaging required effort, leading to stress, anxiety, exhaustion and feeling ‘burnt out’. They expressed a desire for an inclusive, understanding and accommodating environment where they would feel more comfortable disclosing their diagnosis without feeling they needed to conceal their autistic traits and behaviour. These preliminary findings add to the current literature regarding autism, camouflaging and employment.
Lay abstract
When applying for a job, autistic job candidates are likely to face a number of challenges. Job interviews are one of these challenges – they require communicating and relationship-building with unfamiliar people and involve expectations about behaviour (that may vary between companies and are not made clear to job candidates). Given autistic people communicate differently to non-autistic people, autistic job candidates may be disadvantaged in the interview process. Autistic candidates may not feel comfortable or safe sharing with organisations their autistic identity and may feel pressure to hide any characteristics or behaviour they feel might indicate they are autistic. To explore this issue, we interviewed 10 autistic adults about their job interview experiences in Australia. We analysed the content of the interviews and found three themes that related to the individual person and three themes that related to environmental factors. Participants told us that they engaged in camouflaging behaviour during job interviews, feeling pressure to conceal aspects of themselves. Those who camouflaged during job interviews reported that it took a lot of effort, which resulted in increased stress, anxiety and exhaustion. The autistic adults we spoke to reported a need for inclusive, understanding and accommodating employers to help them feel more comfortable disclosing their autism diagnosis in the job application process. These findings add to current research that has explored camouflaging behaviour and barriers to employment for autistic people.},

This study is the first to take a multi-informant, longitudinal approach to examine corporate work-placement schemes: specifically, an internship for autistic graduates at Deutsche Bank, UK. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with interns, their hiring managers and the colleagues who worked alongside them. Results demonstrated positive, meaningful experiences for the majority of those involved, however, some interns also reported anxiety, difficulties in judging communication and confusion regarding office rules. The current findings contribute to a better understanding of the experiences of skilled autistic individuals in work, and should inform the creation of subsequent programmes aimed to promote employment opportunities for autistic people.},

The second case study was at a five-star hotel situated in a large city where a buddy system innovation programme was used in the induction and training process of WWID.,The overarching “life theme” created through these innovation programs was one of enhanced and creative opportunities for social inclusion. The participants displayed more confidence and independence in their ability and exhibited aspirations to advance and succeed in their roles.,The study argues that HR professionals need to be more proactive in finding innovative ways to engage WWID in the early stages of employment.,The qualitative study is underpinned by socialisation and career construction theory which provides the framework to discuss the ways in which socialisation and socially inclusive HRM practices enable participants and other WWID achieve success on their career paths. The key message of our research is that early vocational socialisation innovation programs can make a positive difference to the work experiences of WWID.},

	abstract = {Background
Despite difficulties entering the workforce, people on the autism spectrum are often successful. Furthermore, they are suggested to bring unique abilities (e.g., attention to detail, tolerance for repetitive tasks) related to the repetitive and restrictive behaviours and interests (RRBI) diagnostic domain, that may be advantageous in employment.
Aims
This critical and systematic review examined evidence supporting the superior workplace performance of employees on the autism spectrum, particularly regarding the RRBI domain.
Method and procedures
A systematic review (PRISMA guidelines) evaluated empirical peer-reviewed studies that assess employees on the autism spectrum’s performance in the workplace or on work-specific tasks. Nine databases were searched, with additional papers identified from reference lists and consultation.
Outcomes and results
Two quantitative and four qualitative papers met criteria. Results reflect themes; attention to detail, tolerance of repetitive tasks, special/circumscribed interests, other RRBI related advantages/concerns.
Conclusions and implications
Due to the nature and quality of the identified studies there is currently no strong evidence supporting or negating a workplace autism advantage. This review highlights the need for more research and urges constraint in utilising stereotypes that may not apply to all on the autism spectrum, arguing an individual differences approach to supporting autism strengths at work.},

	abstract = {Workplaces are adopting the label neurodiversity to acknowledge variation in cognitive abilities among workers. However, continued research and development is needed to advance workplace practices and social environments that reflect a fully inclusive approach to neurodiversity. Current workplace practices for recruiting and integrating workers with neurodivergent features are often congruent with approaches to disability, with an emphasis on protections against discrimination and providing accommodations for workers to perform in the neurotypical work environment. Similar to disabilities in general, workers with neurodivergent features may need to disclose in order to determine if the features qualify as a disability and subsequently benefit from protections against discrimination and receive accommodations to perform work tasks that were designed with the neurotypical worker in mind. However, the decision to disclose either formally to organization leadership or informally to co-workers involves careful consideration of the costs and benefits of doing so. In this chapter, we discuss the costs and benefits of disclosing neurodivergent features in the workplace, and the role that workplace environments and neurodivergent features play in those consequences. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities specific to disclosure of neurodivergent features and how those research endeavors and organizational practices might adapt as workplace environments embrace a neurodiversity perspective.},
