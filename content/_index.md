      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''

        I am committed to improving the health and wellbeing of neurodivergent people, especially autistic people and those with learning disabilities. My interests span several areas, each addressing different facets of health and healthcare disparities in these populations.

        One focus of my work is the relationship between sensory processing and mental health, particularly how sensory experiences influence anxiety in autistic individuals. This interest began with my PhD research, where I used both experimental and questionnaire methods to explore their bidirectional relationship. Another strand of my work examines how social determinants - such as socioeconomic status and access to public services - affect health outcomes for neurodivergent people. In my current role with the Scottish Learning Disabilities Observatory, I use large administrative datasets to uncover patterns and disparities that shape healthcare access and overall wellbeing for autistic people and those with learning disabilities.
