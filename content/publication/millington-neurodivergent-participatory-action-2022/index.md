abstract: Purpose This paper aims to raise awareness of and argue for the use of participatory
  methods for the research and development of Virtual Reality (VR) applications designed
  for neurodivergent groups. This includes exploring why it is important to meaningfully
  include neurodivergent groups and the benefits their inclusion provide. Design/methodology/approach
  VR is becoming increasingly widespread as a consumer product and interventional
  tool. It is vital for researchers and developers to embrace best practices in these
  early stages of using the technology, making certain that neurodivergent people
  have the best possible outcomes. Findings The neurodivergent community is dissatisfied
  with many of the research directions currently being undertaken. This dissatisfaction
  arises from conflicting priorities between different stakeholders and the lack of
  input from the community. Participatory research brings neurodivergent people into
  the research process, whether as members of the research team or as consultants
  at key steps. Effective participatory research ensures that the priorities of the
  neurodivergent community are better incorporated in research, as well as enabling
  the development of more effective applications for VR. Originality/value Participatory
  methods are unutilised in the development of applications aimed for neurodivergent
  people. By describing their use and utility in other areas, this article aims to
  encourage other VR researchers to take neurodivergent people on board.
