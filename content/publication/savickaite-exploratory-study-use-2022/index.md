abstract: 'Purpose Global and local processing is part of human perceptual organisation,
  where global processing helps extract the “gist” of the visual information and local
  processing helps perceive the details. Individual differences in these two types
  of visual processing have been found in autism and ADHD (Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity
  Disorder). Virtual reality (VR) has become a more available method of research in
  the last few decades. No previous research has investigated perceptual differences
  using this technology. Design/methodology/approach The objective of the research
  is to threefold: (1) identify if there is association between ADHD and autistic
  traits and the performance on the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure (ROCF) task, (2)
  investigate practical effects of using VR drawing tools for research on perceptual
  experiences and (3) explore any perceptual differences brought out by the three-dimensional
  nature of the VR. The standard ROCF test was used as a baseline task to investigate
  the practical utility of using VR as an experimental platform. A total of 94 participants
  were tested. Findings Attention-to-detail, attention switching and imagination subscales
  of autism quotient (AQ) questionnaire were found to be predictors of organisational
  ROCF scores, whereas only the attention-to-detail subscale was predictive of perceptual
  ROCF scores. Originality/value The current study is an example of how classic psychological
  paradigms can be transferred into the virtual world. Further investigation of the
  distinct individual preferences in drawing tasks in VR could lead to a better understanding
  of individual differences in the processing of visuospatial information.'
