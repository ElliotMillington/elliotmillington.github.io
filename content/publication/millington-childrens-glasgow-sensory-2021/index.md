abstract: 'Sensory sensitivities have been linked to autism in a growing body of literature.
  Despite this, current measures assessing sensory sensitivities do not appear to
  fully capture this, especially in children. This study aimed to adapt an adult measure
  of sensory sensitivities – the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire – for use with children
  aged between aged between 8 and 11. 234 children filled out this adaption while
  their caregivers completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient: Children’s Version. The
  results found that the two questionnaires had a significant but surprisingly small
  correlation. Future work should look at identifying the extent to which the Children’s
  Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is capturing greater sensory difficulties in non-autistic
  children or increased measurement error.'
