abstract: Global and local processing is part of human perceptual organisation, where
  global processing enables  us to extract the ‘gist’ of the visual information and
  local processing helps us to perceive the details.  Individual differences in these
  two types of visual processing have been found in autism and ADHD.  Virtual Reality
  (VR) has become a more available method of research in the last few decades. No  previous
  research has investigated perceptual differences using this technology. The standard
  ROCF  test was used as a baseline task to look at a practical aspect of using VR
  as an experimental platform.  94 participants were tested. Attention-to-Detail,
  Attention Switching and Imagination subscales of AQ  questionnaire were found to
  be predictors of organisational ROCF scores, whereas only Attention-to?Detail subscale
  was predictive of perceptual ROCF scores. Current study is an example of how classic  psychological
  paradigms can be transferred into the virtual world. Further investigation of the
  distinct  individual preferences in drawing tasks in VR could lead to a better understanding
  on how we process  visuospatial information. As a result, such findings would inevitably
  extend to industrial applications.
