 abstract = {Video games are commonly of interest in autism, with autistic adolescents playing twice as much as their Typically Developing peers. The aims of this study are to investigate whether motivations to play video games measured using the Gaming Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences Scales and autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient can predict time spent playing video games. 57 participants were recruited from internet forums and completed an online questionnaire. The preliminary results revealed that only escapism and social motivation predicted time spent playing games. Further investigation revealed interactions between autistic traits and several motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and customisation. This has consequences for future research into how autistic people use video games to ease their anxieties.},
