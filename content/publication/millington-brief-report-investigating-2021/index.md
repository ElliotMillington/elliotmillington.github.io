abstract: Video games are commonly of interest in autism, with autistic adolescents
  playing twice as much as their Typically Developing peers. The aims of this study
  are to investigate whether motivations to play video games measured using the Gaming
  Attitudes, Motivations and Experiences Scales and autistic traits using the Autism
  Spectrum Quotient can predict time spent playing video games. 57 participants were
  recruited from internet forums and completed an online questionnaire. The preliminary
  results revealed that only escapism and social motivation predicted time spent playing
  games. Further investigation revealed interactions between autistic traits and several
  motivational scales, including escapism, completionism, and customisation. This
  has consequences for future research into how autistic people use video games to
  ease their anxieties.
