 abstract = {As VR technology matures, it offers opportunities to provide state of the art learning experiences. The use of this technology in education is not new, however, it can be significantly improved. Situated (or contextual) learning is one of the key pillars of immersive learning. Multi-user interaction in virtual environments has always been one of the goals of VR and this has been represented by the tools developed for it. In this preliminary work, we aim to introduce Project Mobius, which is a collaborative project between Edify.ac and the University of Glasgow. We describe how our multi-user lab has been set up and potential future applications for teaching and learning.},
