      Elliot’s work with the Scottish Learning Disabilities Observatory focuses on analysing large administrative datasets to examine how social determinants, such as socioeconomic status and access to public services, impact health outcomes and healthcare access for autistic people and people with learning disabilities. Through this research, he aims to identify and address disparities that contribute to health inequalities in these communities.

## About Me

Elliot is committed to improving the health and wellbeing of neurodivergent people, particularly autistic people and those with learning disabilities. His research interests span several areas, each addressing different facets of health and healthcare disparities in these populations.

One focus of his work is the relationship between sensory processing and mental health, especially how sensory experiences influence anxiety in autistic people. This interest began with his PhD research, where he employed both experimental and questionnaire methods to explore their bidirectional relationship. Another strand of his work examines how social determinants—such as socioeconomic status and access to public services—affect health outcomes for neurodivergent people. In his current role with the Scottish Learning Disabilities Observatory, Elliot uses large administrative datasets to uncover patterns and disparities that shape healthcare access and overall wellbeing for autistic individuals and those with learning disabilities.
